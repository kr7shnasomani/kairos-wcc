"""
Kairos — Domain-expert benchmark (PS "Evaluation Focus").

Methodology (fully deterministic — no LLM judge, so every number is reproducible):
  • Per-question routing  — each question pulls context from the right source(s):
    hybrid `/search`, the asset's graph `/knowledge`, and/or `/aliases`.
  • Retrieval precision    — keyword-in-context signal (does the fact reach the context?).
  • Answer quality         — the synthesized answer must *state* the required fact(s) and not negate
    them: `must_all` = every token (exact/multi-part facts), `answer_any` = any correct-answer token
    (comparative questions), else `expect_any`. A fact wrapped in a negator ("not 16.2") fails.
  • Provenance             — every non-refused answer must cite sources[] (Kairos: no claim w/o provenance).
  • KG linkage             — deterministic Cypher (assets linked, edges, verification).
  • Time-to-answer         — latency per question.
Entity-extraction F1 is the Layer-0 model gate: backend/scripts/run_model_validation.py.

Streams per question. Requires the golden dataset loaded (`make load-dataset`).
Run:
    docker exec kairos-backend-api python benchmark/run_benchmark.py                 # full (routing + synthesis + grading)
    docker exec kairos-backend-api python benchmark/run_benchmark.py --retrieval-only # fast, retrieval + KG only

WHY THERE IS A --delay, AND WHY IT DEFAULTS TO NON-ZERO
  The shared NVIDIA NIM endpoint has a heavy, random latency tail that worsens under
  back-to-back load. Measured on one identical 73-token synthesis payload:

      back-to-back : 30.2s · TIMEOUT(78s) · 47.4s · 14.2s
      paced 20s    :  8.6s · 10.6s · 16.2s

  No rate-limit headers are returned — the endpoint just queues. A NIM call that outlives
  NVIDIA_NIM_TIMEOUT falls through to the Gemini tier, which is a *free-tier key*; enough
  fallthrough in one run exhausts it, after which Gemini returns 429 and every subsequent
  NIM timeout becomes a no-answer. That is measured as poor answer quality, which it is not.

  So pacing is not politeness — it is what keeps the run on the model whose quality is being
  measured. Note the corollary: LOWERING NVIDIA_NIM_TIMEOUT does not speed anything up, it
  just caps the number and moves the work to Gemini, burning the free tier faster.

  The run now reports which provider answered each question and refuses to present a
  contaminated run as a clean measurement.
