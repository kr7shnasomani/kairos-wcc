PTW dual sign-off (Layer 8, architecture Flow B) — pure logic, no network, no Supabase.

Guards the bug this endpoint was written to fix: `ack` deliberately withholds
`acknowledged_at` for PTW briefs, so without a working countersign path a
safety-critical brief could never reach acknowledged state at all.
