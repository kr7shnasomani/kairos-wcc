# Kairos Agent Skills Manifest

Skills grouped by domain for fast lookup. Most are vendored in `.agents/skills/`; the ones marked **global (not vendored in this repo)** were removed from there because they now live in the global `~/.claude/skills` (or the plugin that provides them), and are invoked by name exactly the same way.

## AI / HuggingFace {#ai-huggingface}

### `huggingface-best`
Use when the user asks about finding the best, top, or recommended model for a task, wants to know what AI model to use, or wants to compare models by benchmark scores. Triggers on: "best model for X", "what model should I use for", "top models for [task]", "which model runs on my laptop/machine/device", "recommend a model for", "what LLM should I use for", "compare models for", "what's state of the art for", or any question about choosing an AI model for a specific use case. Always use this skill when the user wants model recommendations or comparisons, even if they don't explicitly mention HuggingFace or benchmarks.

**Path**: `.agents/skills/huggingface-best/SKILL.md`

### `huggingface-local-models`
Use to select models to run locally with llama.cpp and GGUF on CPU, Mac Metal, CUDA, or ROCm. Covers finding GGUFs, quant selection, running servers, exact GGUF file lookup, conversion, and OpenAI-compatible local serving.

## Ponytail (Complexity Control) {#ponytail}

### `ponytail`
Forces the laziest solution that actually works, simplest, shortest, most minimal. Channels a senior dev who has seen everything: question whether the task needs to exist at all (YAGNI), reach for the standard library before custom code, native platform features before dependencies, one line before fifty. Supports intensity levels: lite, full (default), ultra. Use whenever the user says "ponytail", "be lazy", "lazy mode", "simplest solution", "minimal solution", "yagni", "do less", or "shortest path", and whenever they complain about over-engineering, bloat, boilerplate, or unnecessary dependencies.

**Path**: global (not vendored in this repo)

### `ponytail-audit`
Whole-repo audit for over-engineering. Like ponytail-review, but scans the entire codebase instead of a diff: a ranked list of what to delete, simplify, or replace with stdlib/native equivalents. Use when the user says "audit this codebase", "audit for over-engineering", "what can I delete from this repo", "find bloat", "ponytail-audit", or "/ponytail-audit". One-shot report, does not apply fixes.

**Path**: global (not vendored in this repo)

### `ponytail-debt`
Harvest every `ponytail:` comment in the codebase into a debt ledger, so the deliberate shortcuts and deferrals ponytail leaves behind get tracked instead of rotting into "later means never". Use when the user says "ponytail debt", "/ponytail-debt", "what did ponytail defer", "list the shortcuts", "ponytail ledger", or "what did we mark to do later". One-shot report, changes nothing.

**Path**: global (not vendored in this repo)

### `ponytail-review`
Code review focused exclusively on over-engineering. Finds what to delete: reinvented standard library, unneeded dependencies, speculative abstractions, dead flexibility. One line per finding: location, what to cut, what replaces it. Use when the user says "review for over-engineering", "what can we delete", "is this over-engineered", "simplify review", or invokes /ponytail-review. Complements correctness-focused review, this one only hunts complexity.

## Utilities {#utilities}

### `agent-browser`
Browser automation CLI for AI agents. Use when the user needs to interact with websites, including navigating pages, filling forms, clicking buttons, taking screenshots, extracting data, testing web apps, or automating any browser task. Triggers include requests to "open a website", "fill out a form", "click a button", "take a screenshot", "scrape data from a page", "test this web app", "login to a site", "automate browser actions", or any task requiring programmatic web interaction. Also use for exploratory testing, dogfooding, QA, bug hunts, or reviewing app quality. Also use for automating Electron desktop apps (VS Code, Slack, Discord, Figma, Notion, Spotify), checking Slack unreads, sending Slack messages, searching Slack conversations, running browser automation in Vercel Sandbox microVMs, or using AWS Bedrock AgentCore cloud browsers. Prefer agent-browser over any built-in browser automation or web tools.

### `find-skills`
Helps users discover and install agent skills when they ask questions like "how do I do X", "find a skill for X", "is there a skill that can...", or express interest in extending capabilities. This skill should be used when the user is looking for functionality that might exist as an installable skill.
