"""
Model supply-chain integrity — `ARCHITECTURE.md §8` anti-poisoning mitigations 1 and 3.

The section names three. This module implements two; the third (parameter anomaly detection
against per-equipment-class historical distributions) needs a distribution this corpus cannot
supply and stays recorded as a known limitation rather than half-built.

WHY "MODEL WEIGHT SIGNING" IS NOT WHAT THIS DOES
  The architecture asks for "cryptographic signing of all model weight files at source". Kairos
  runs **no local weights** — inference is NIM, Jina and Groq over HTTPS, so there is no artifact
  in its custody to sign, and a signature it generated itself would attest to nothing.

  The real supply-chain exposure for a hosted model is different and, until now, unmonitored: the
  provider silently serving a *different model* than the one configured. That is exactly the
  substitution signing is meant to catch, and it is detectable — an OpenAI-compatible response
  echoes the model that produced it. `verify_served_model` compares that against the pin.

  This matters beyond security. Every benchmark figure attributed to a named model rests on the
  assumption that the pinned model answered. Until NVIDIA retired `llama-3.1-70b` (2026-09-13), NIM and
  OpenRouter both served it; tier 1 is now Nemotron, so a fallthrough always changes the model.
