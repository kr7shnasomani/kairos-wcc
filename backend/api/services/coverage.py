"""
Knowledge-coverage service — what the platform actually knows, per asset.

Answers the question the deck calls a "knowledge-coverage heatmap": *where is our knowledge thin?*
Every number is read live from the stores that already own it — the graph for facts, Supabase for
documents and quarantine, the compliance layer for gaps. Nothing here is computed speculatively or
cached; a blank cell means "we genuinely hold nothing", which is the finding, not a rendering bug.

Deliberately read-only and model-free: no OCR, NER or embedding call is made, so this costs no
provider quota and can be refreshed as often as the page likes.
