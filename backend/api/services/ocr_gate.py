OCR accuracy scoring — the Layer 0 gate's extension to the OCR artifact.

`ARCHITECTURE.md` Layer 0: "Entity extraction is the gated artifact today; OCR, synthesis, and
entity linking are the extension path along the same interface."

WHY NOT CHARACTER ERROR RATE
  CER is the textbook OCR metric and it is the wrong one here. It weights every character equally,
  so a run that mangles whitespace and headers but preserves every number scores badly, while a
  run that reads "16.2 bar" as "18.5 bar" — the single most dangerous error this system can make,
  and a real pressure limit in this corpus — barely moves it.

  What matters industrially is whether the **operationally salient tokens survive**: asset tags,
  measured values with units, standards references, document ids, dates. Those are the things a
  technician acts on and the things the graph links. So the metric is recall over those tokens.

  This is the same principle as the model gate excluding ground truth outside the extractor's
  taxonomy: score what the artifact is actually for.

GROUND TRUTH ALREADY EXISTS
  It was claimed the corpus has no labelled OCR ground truth. `dataset/00_Reference/
  dataset_manifest.csv` declares three pairings **by design**:
    file 20 scanned_oem_bulletin_degraded.png -> "Same content as file 6"
    file 21 scanned_inspection_degraded.png   -> "Same content as file 12"
    files 22/23 handwritten_*.png             -> file 24 shift_log.txt, "same 2 events"
  The clean sibling's extracted text is the reference. No new labelling was required.

WHAT THIS CANNOT TELL YOU
  Token recall is not transcription quality: an OCR pass that emits the right numbers inside
  garbled prose scores well here and would still be unusable for retrieval. It is the safety-
  relevant direction, not a complete picture. Pair it with a human read of one sample.
