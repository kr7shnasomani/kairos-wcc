Corpus hygiene — telling real vault documents apart from test artifacts.

WHY THIS EXISTS
  The test suite and hand-run sweeps write real rows into the vault. They carry ordinary random
  `DOC-` ids, so **only the file name identifies them**. On 2026-08-23 the active vault held 23
  real corpus documents against 85 test artifacts — 79% noise — and anything that counts or
  renders documents without excluding them is reporting test hygiene rather than the plant.

  `benchmark/run_kg_completeness.py` hit this first: linkage read 70/108 = 64% until the
  artifacts left the denominator, at which point the real figure was 18/23. The harness was
  fixed; every user-facing surface was not, which is why `GET /assets/{id}/knowledge` returned
  60 edges for EQ-101 of which ~53 pointed at `test_*` files.

  This module is the single definition. The benchmark imports it rather than keeping its own
  copy — `benchmark/` already depends on `api/`, so the direction is api → benchmark and never
  the reverse.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT EXCLUDED
  A `document_id` with **no vault row at all** is never treated as a test artifact. Promotion
  from quarantine mints `PROMOTED-<uuid>` ids for field knowledge that never had a vault
  document (`routers/governance.py`), so "not in `documents`" means "cannot classify", and the
  conservative answer is to keep it. Over-widening this predicate deletes real evidence from a
  view; under-widening merely leaves noise visible.

NEVER SILENTLY
  Callers are expected to report how many they excluded. A filter that hides its own effect is
  precisely how the linkage number was wrong for as long as it was.

# `e2e_` and `kairos_` were added 2026-08-23 (decision D8). Both name a file after *this system*
# or its test harness, never after plant equipment, and both were verified against the whole
# vault to match exactly their two targets — `e2e_shift_log.txt` and `kairos_ingest_test.pdf` —
# neither of which appears in `dataset/00_Reference/dataset_manifest.csv` or anywhere under
# `dataset/`. A `_test\.ext` stem rule was considered for the second and REJECTED: it would also
# swallow a plausible real document like `hydro_test.pdf`, and hiding plant evidence is the one
# failure this predicate must not have.

# Widen this ONLY with evidence: `backend/scripts/purge_test_data.py` has destroyed real
# documents once by widening a match pattern, and while this module deletes nothing, a pattern
# that swallows a real file name makes genuine evidence invisible in the UI, which is its own
# kind of data loss.
