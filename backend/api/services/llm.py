    The context items permitted to clear the safety gate.

    The gate used to take `min(authority_level)` over the **whole** retrieved context, making it a
    property of the context *set* rather than of the evidence supporting the answer: one unrelated
    authoritative document anywhere in the context cleared it, and in the live copilot that was the
    normal case, so the gate almost never fired.

    Two filters, both derived from measured behaviour on the real corpus
    (query: "Which valves make up the isolation boundary for V-247?"):

      1. **Most relevant only.** Ranked by `relevance_score` (the RRF fusion score), NOT by
         position — `SearchService` sorts by `(authority_level, -rrf)`, so the most authoritative
         document is always first and a top-K-by-position filter would be a no-op. This drops the
         generic L1 "Applicable Standards and Statutory Provisions" list, which measured as the
         *least* relevant hit (rrf 0.0156) yet was clearing every safety refusal.

      2. **Same asset as the best evidence.** Relevance alone was not enough: two Fischer OEM
         bulletins (L3, rrf ~0.031) about `EQ-101` centrifugal-pump seals still ranked inside the
         top 3 for a question about a `V-247` valve, and an OEM bulletin for different equipment
         cannot vouch for this one. The target asset is taken from the highest-relevance item.

    Deliberately conservative in both directions: a document with no `asset_id` never vouches when
    a target asset is known, and when nothing carries a `relevance_score` the whole context is
    returned — i.e. previous behaviour — because callers that assemble context by hand (graph
