# Gap detection — evaluated per (Regulation × applicable Asset) pair.
#
# A clause is *covered* for an asset when that asset has an active, non-superseded
# edge to a Document of the evidence type the clause actually requires
# (`reg.requires_document_type`, seeded in scripts/seed_regulations.py). Three outcomes:
#
#   gap                 no evidence document of the required type exists
#   unverified_evidence the document exists but no human has verified the edge
#   covered             verified evidence exists — not returned as a finding
#
# This replaces an earlier check that asked only "does this asset have any verified
# procedure at all", which ignored the clause entirely and — because nothing but manual
# quarantine promotion ever writes verification_status='verified' — reported every
# (regulation, asset) pair as a gap unconditionally.
#
# ponytail: `applies_to_equipment_class IS NULL` = clause applies to all equipment classes;
# `requires_document_type IS NULL` (pre-mapping seeds) = any document type counts, which
# keeps older graphs working instead of reporting a false gap on every clause.
# Evidence typing is exact document_type matching. Upgrade to embedding the clause's
# requirement_text against document chunks when clauses need finer granularity than type.
# `CALL { WITH reg, a ... }` is the pre-2025 subquery form. The modern `CALL (reg, a) { ... }`
# needs Neo4j 2025.01+, and the local-stores profile pins neo4j:5.20-community — this form
# runs on both 5.20 and Aura. Switch when the 5.20 pin moves.
