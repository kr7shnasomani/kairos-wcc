    best available evidence was the authority-4 site PTW, the gate correctly refused it, and the

    Two properties make this safe to admit:

    - **The edge's own authority, not an invented one.** `authority_level` and `confidence` are
      read off the `CONTAINS_TOPOLOGY_ELEMENT` edge. Topology does not get a privileged authority
      for being topology; it clears the gate only if the edge it came from already would.

    `asset_id` is set to the queried tag so `_authority_candidates`' same-asset filter matches, and
