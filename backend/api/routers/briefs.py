    load-bearing and easy to break by reordering:

      * `limit` applies AFTER filtering, never in SQL. Limiting the query made held
        and frozen briefs compete with critical ones for the same N rows, so a user
        holding N critical briefs never saw a normal-priority brief again even once
        the governor cleared. The governor defers a brief; it must not hide one.
      * The page is trimmed BEFORE the caller records pushes. A brief that did not
        make the page was not delivered and must not spend EEMUA governor budget.
      * `delivered + frozen_page` never exceeds `limit`. `limit` is the caller's
        page size, not a per-category allowance.
