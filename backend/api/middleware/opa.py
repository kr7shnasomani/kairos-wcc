"""
OPA middleware — policy enforcement for write operations and sensitive reads.
Calls kairos-opa for the enforced routes; denies with 403 if OPA returns false.
Skips the check when `dev_bypass_allowed` and no Authorization header (dev bypass, same as auth).

Fails **closed**: if OPA cannot be reached, the request is denied outside dev. An authorization
layer that answers "allow" when it is down is not an authorization layer.
