// group sets its own <title>, and AppShell doesn't either — a route missing from this
// list, or listed only under a shorter prefix, shows the wrong title in both cases,
// not just on refresh, which is how /system-benchmarks (since removed) and /overview/coverage were
// found and fixed 2026-08-24: the first had no entry at all (bare "Kairos"), the second
// fell through to the generic "/overview" entry ("Kairos: Overview") because a
// specific one wasn't listed above it. `.find()` returns the first array match, so a
// specific prefix MUST be listed before any shorter prefix it also satisfies.
