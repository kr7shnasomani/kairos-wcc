# Kairos — Integration Test Suite

## How to run

All tests run **inside Docker**. There is no host shortcut: host package resolution differs from
the pinned images and produces false results — `auth.test.ts` and `api.test.ts` fail on the host
and pass in the container. A host run will lie to you.

### Flow checks — the stack, driven through the UI (`tools/e2e_flows.sh`)

Walks what a reviewer clicks, as each persona, against a loaded stack: pages render with no error screen
or console error, role redirects, API refusals (field worker → quarantine 403, engineer → PTW countersign
403), a sourced Copilot answer and a safety refusal, an RCA pack with no duplicated events, and an audit
pack that lists each document once. Uses host-installed `agent-browser`, so it runs on a developer
machine, not in CI.

```bash
./tools/e2e_flows.sh            # changes no workflow state — safe on demo data
./tools/e2e_flows.sh --mutate   # also PTW dual sign-off, deviation raise/resolve, supersede via the UI
```

`--mutate` leaves signed briefs, a resolved deviation and a superseded document behind: run it on a stack
you will reset, never on the dataset you are about to demo or benchmark.

### Tier 1 — service-free (960 tests, no stack, no secrets, no network)

These need nothing running. This is what CI's `unit` job executes on every push. The container run is **786 passed and 3 skipped** (2026-10-01): the Docker test image mounts only `./backend`, `./tests` and `./db`, so the checks in `test_sec_infra.py` that read `infra/`, `docker-compose*.yml` and `.github/` skip there (they run on a full checkout, and in CI, which has the whole repo).

```bash
docker compose run --rm --no-deps -e KAIROS_SKIP_TEST_CLEANUP=1 kairos-backend-api \
  pytest -q tests/test_{pii,query_category,search_fusion,ingestion_formats,http_pool,model_validation,pid,auth_cache,\

```

All **54** files, **960 tests** (counted 2026-10-03; matches the 54 `tests/test_*.py` entries in `.github/workflows/tests.yml`). Recent additions:

**Security pass, 2026-10-01: the five `test_sec_*.py` files.** Each is named for the review group it covers; all run against in-memory fakes, with nothing written to any store. Finding ids (H1, M4, ...) are the 2026-09-30 security review's, listed one per line in `implementation/status.md` § Accepted risks and deploy checklist.

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `test_sec_auth.py` | Role and `site_id` come from `app_metadata` only and a self-edited `user_metadata` grants nothing (H1); the roles migration is dry-run by default and never overwrites (`scripts/migrate_roles_to_app_metadata.py`); constant-time internal key compare (L4); `APP_ENV` is normalised and only `development` is development (L5); the boot guard needs `MOC_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (H7); login, refresh and DB errors do not echo upstream text (L6); `POST /auth/logout` revokes and drops the cache (L1, server-side half); `/health/detailed` is gated while `/health/`, `/docs` and `/openapi.json` stay public (L7); the seeder refuses blank passwords and no seeded password is committed; display names ignore `user_metadata` |
| `test_sec_authz.py` | `ingest_event` mapping, OPA grants and `_sensitive_actions` (H2); site scope on event reports, plant state, asset reads and create, events reads, audit pack (H3 route gate, M8); inspection `document_id` must be an `inspection_report` and the evidence confidence is capped (H3); acknowledgements use the token actor, are idempotent and 404/403 correctly, deviation-flag, tag-out and elicitation actors come from the token (M6); annotation corpus roles, dedup and rate limit (M7); off-boarding programmes limited to staff and the subject (M9); voice-upload size and path sanitising (M11, M12); inbox `.in_()` filter (M2); final acks and feedback visibility (L11); MoC webhook HMAC with timestamp, skew, raw body, fail-closed and replay (H7); OPA path and rate-limit exemption cannot be forged through `Host` |
| `test_sec_documents.py` | Document type allow-list, safe filenames, `authority_capped` with the audit record, unknown asset, `occurred_at` bounds (H5, M12); normalised content type and forced-download signed URLs (L10); storage errors leak no text (L6); supersede gate: self, inactive replacement, role, MoC created once, approved applies, rejected blocks, operational documents immediate (H6); PDF page, DPI, pixel and spreadsheet ceilings and non-retryable `BadFile` (M11); confirmed-aliases-only pipeline (M13); per-document topology node ids (L12); broader PII patterns and late names (L9) |
| `test_sec_infra.py` | RLS on every schema table and migration 017 covering the 14 late ones (M1); Caddy body cap and headers (M11); dev connector port bound to loopback and callers sending `X-Connector-Secret` (M14); third-party Actions pinned to commit SHAs (L15). Skips for the files the container does not mount |
| `test_sec_llm.py` | Forged client `context` and `query_category` cannot clear the gate, the server retrieves its own evidence, bad `as_of` is 422, request bounds (H4, M11); the stream writes the audit row and `pending_moc` (M3); escaped document text and system-message rules, lowest `CONFIDENCE` wins, last `SOURCES_USED` wins, phantom citations and missing confidence refuse, RCA prompt escaping and citation filtering, NER default confidence below 0.7 (M4); formerly ungated wordings are classified, every named asset must be anchored, aliases resolve (M5); RCA pack site boundary (M8); NER honours the configured base URL (L8) |

Existing files changed with it: `test_event_reorder.py` (a duplicate check never records the event, only `mark_seen` after a successful ingest does; `_store_event` inserts, accepts an identical retry, never overwrites another event; the pending-brief slot is per work order; a PTW never cancels another brief; the 4-hour cool-down is per trigger type), `test_authz_boundary.py`, `test_config_guardrail.py`, `test_query_category.py` and `test_synthesis_stream.py` (server-side evidence), plus the stack-tier `test_auth.py`, `test_health.py`, `test_ot_connector.py` and `conftest.py` (seed passwords from `.env`, connector secret).
`test_alias_expansion.py` — a query naming a confirmed alias (P-101) also searches its canonical asset.
`test_ner_fallback.py` — NIM NER calls are capped at 4 concurrent; a timeout or 5xx is retried but a 4xx
is not; a long document is extracted in chunks and merged, and a failed chunk keeps the others while
flagging recall as a floor; an unset `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` goes straight to regex.
`test_asset_tag_filter.py` — document references (WO-, PTW-, SOP-, month-year stamps) never become
alias candidates or quarantine items, and "HE-301 Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger" resolves to HE-301.
`test_linked_document_scope.py` — an asset-scoped search also matches documents the graph links to the
asset, the asset's own documents rank first within an authority level, and a graph outage degrades to
the primary-asset scope.
`test_nim_retry.py` — the shared provider call path and the registry behind it: a 502/503/504 is
retried once before the cascade hands the answer to a different model, a client error is never
retried, each tier posts its own model id and only its own `extra_body` keys, an unkeyed tier is
absent from the cascade entirely, Token Factory takes tier 1 when keyed, and a tier that already failed this request (a broken stream) is skipped rather than retried. Filename kept because
CI's service-free job lists test files by name.
`test_rca_timeline.py` — the RCA timeline shows an event recorded in both Supabase and Neo4j once, orders
mixed UTC offsets by instant, and reads a naive timestamp as UTC.
`test_supabase_http.py` — Supabase REST reads survive a dropped pooled HTTP/2 connection: a GET/HEAD that hits a
dead connection is retried once, a second failure still raises, a write is never replayed, and every PostgREST
session in the process goes through the retry transport.
`test_tenant_isolation.py` — showcase data stays out of real accounts (`services/tenant.py`): the shape of every
PostgREST, Cypher and search filter (a nullable column keeps its NULL rows, wildcards are `*`), a registry of the
list and aggregate reads that must be scoped, the demo write fence and its route registry (every allowed route is
real, every guarded route calls a guard, the closed set is pinned), the by-id read fence (a real account gets 404 on a showcase record, every by-id GET route names a parameter the fence understands), the target guards, the demo role's role mapping,
the hourly demo budget, statistics a showcase action must not feed, and the `_demo` stores never being created at
startup.
`test_showcase_dataset.py` — the showcase plant (`scripts/showcase/`, `scripts/load_showcase.py`): the six-folder dataset (written, read back, and bound to load time exactly as a fresh build would be, the loader never rebuilding it), size, unique
`DEMO-` ids, parents before children, no golden name or tag reused, every document names its asset and every
conflict is stated by both of its sources, every direct row carries a marker, ids are deterministic and dates move
with the anchor, every state the governance pages show exists, the permit waiting for a second signature, recurring
failures and cross-system clock drift, live events valid for the real API, the loader's `--apply` gate and its
real-mode count check, the redate shift (whole days, full rows, loader ids only) and the reset (state only, never the
vault, never an unfiltered delete).
`test_redate_demo.py` — the demo re-date shift (`scripts/redate_demo.py`): only events the loader created from
the dataset move (a live or QA event newer than the story neither anchors nor moves), the newest lands on
"yesterday", spacing and time of day are kept, payload and Neo4j timestamps keep their source offset, and a
same-day re-run shifts by 0.
`test_synthesis_stream.py` also pins the streaming route's terminal events: a successful stream ends on `done` with
no `error`, and a failed one ends on `error` without exposing the exception text.
`test_image_utils.py` — the one shared NIM image downscale helper (OCR and P&ID): an image that fits after JPEG
re-encoding keeps full resolution, one already under the ceiling is sent untouched, one no step can fit returns
nothing, and both callers keep their return shapes.
`test_ocr_review_release.py` — releasing a document held by the OCR gate rebuilds ingestion's workflow params
from the stored vault URL and names the reviewer; a document whose artifact path cannot be recovered is refused.
`test_document_extraction_view.py` — the document extraction view and redacted export read entities back from
the graph edges carrying the document id: the entity is the non-document endpoint, a re-linked entity is
listed once at its strongest confidence, and only `MENTIONS_PERSON` names feed redaction.
`test_audit_evidence.py` — the compliance audit pack lists a document linked by several edges or assets
once, verified if any link is, with its highest confidence and every asset it covers.
`test_attribution_evidence.py` (12 tests) covers the pure
decision functions `_attribute` and `_classify_attestation` in `workers/attribution.py`,
including the brownfield regression that `genuine_failure` was unreachable on uninstrumented assets.
`test_authz_boundary.py` (41 tests) covers the trust boundary — which routes are policy-enforced,
that the middleware carries no second token verifier, fail-closed behaviour when OPA is
unreachable, and token-derived site scope.
`test_brief_paging.py` (14 tests) covers `routers/briefs.page_inbox` — the Layer 8 inbox rules that
break silently when reordered: `limit` applies *after* the governor/frozen filters rather than in
SQL (limiting the query let a full page of critical briefs hide a normal-priority one permanently),
the page is trimmed *before* pushes are recorded so an off-page brief cannot spend EEMUA governor
budget, and `delivered + frozen_page` never exceeds `limit`.
`test_quarantine_item_id.py` (10 tests) covers `dependencies.valid_quarantine_item_id` and
asserts all four quarantine-by-id routes are wired to it.
`test_offboarding_session_id.py` (14 tests) covers `routers/elicitation._session_uuid` and pins
the fix for the off-boarding 500s: `offboarding_sessions.id` is a UUID column, so an unparseable
path segment reached PostgREST as 22P02 and surfaced as a 500 on a public route. It also asserts
no off-boarding handler has gone back to `.single()` — that raises PGRST116 on zero rows, which
made each handler's own 404 unreachable and turned every unknown programme into a 500.
`test_purge_safety.py` (24 tests) asserts no purge prefix or exact id can match a real id —
including `WO-2026-0714`, whose promoted item the compliance caveat cites — that every prefix
ends in `-`, and that nothing sits in both a prefix and an `_EXACT` list.
`test_synthesis_stream.py` (14 tests) covers the SSE path: **every safety-critical category
emits zero `delta` events**, the post-gate still retracts a low-confidence answer, the evidence
gate refuses before any provider call, and both synthesis paths call the same two gate methods.
`test_asset_bulk_import.py` (15 tests) covers `routers/assets.partition_import_rows` — existing
assets are skipped rather than overwritten (Neo4j uses `ON CREATE SET`, but the Supabase write is an
`upsert` that would otherwise replace `identity_confirmed_by` on re-import), duplicates within one
payload are reported rather than collapsed, and rows for another site are refused *before* the
existence check so the response cannot leak which asset ids exist in a site the caller cannot read.
The seven conformance files (`briefs_countersign` … `model_gate_classes`) are part of this tier —
an earlier version of this command listed only the first nine and undercounted it.

**This list, `AGENTS.md`'s, and CI's `unit` job must stay identical.** They drifted once already:
CI ran only the first nine files while the docs claimed the whole tier was gated, so eleven
service-free suites — every conformance test among them — never ran on a push. Fixed 2026-08-17.

```bash
```

### Frontend and Go tests (outside the pytest list, not run by CI)

**Frontend (vitest).** `docker compose run --rm --no-deps kairos-frontend npx vitest run` (see `FRONTEND.md` §14 for the memory caveat). Three files were added by the security pass:

| File | Covers |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/security-headers.test.ts` (3) | `next.config.ts` ships CSP, nosniff, referrer and permissions policies on `/:path*`; the CSP allows off-site only the API origin and the YouTube embed and has no `unsafe-eval` in production; development adds `unsafe-eval`, and a bad API URL falls back to localhost (L2) |
| `src/lib/service-worker.test.ts` (4) | Runs `public/sw.js` against a fake worker scope: an API read goes to the network first even when a cached copy exists, the cache is used only when the network fails and only for the same user, a request with no user to key on is not touched, and a `LOGOUT` message deletes every cache (M10) |
| `src/lib/session-security.test.ts` (9) | Route params are `encodeURIComponent`-ed and `api.ts` has no unencoded interpolation left (L3); `clearSession` revokes server side, wipes caches, the queue DB and Copilot history and tells the service worker, while a forced expiry keeps the offline queue and caches; sign-out never blocks when the backend or browser APIs fail; queued writes record the user's `sub`, another user's writes are dropped instead of replayed, and the queue is untouched when nobody is signed in (M10, L1) |

The existing ingest and supersede tests gained cases for the authority selector (levels 1 to 3 only for `reliability` and `admin`, H5), the "Authority lowered" notice, and the `pending_moc_approval` supersede state.

**Go (`go test ./...`, or `make test-connectors` against a running stack).** `backend/connectors/cmd/connector/auth_test.go` (`TestRequireSecret`, `TestValidateConfig`, `TestReceiveWorkOrderBodyLimit`, `TestReceiveWorkOrderDoesNotEchoUpstream`) and `backend/connectors/internal/ot/client_test.go` (`TestPIQueryEscapesTagAndScrubsURL`) cover the `X-Connector-Secret` check, the boot refusal of missing or default secrets, the 1 MiB body cap, no upstream error echo, and PI tag escaping with the historian URL scrubbed from errors (M14, L14).

### Tier 2 — full integration suite (needs the stack)

> **Stack-tier tests not yet updated for the 2026-10-01 rules.** `test_events.py` and `test_governance.py` (and any test that posts events as `field_worker`, supersedes a level 1 to 3 document in one call, or acknowledges an event it is not a recipient of) predate `ingest_event`, the supersede MoC gate, the 409 on a repeated acknowledgement and the `event_id` conflict rule. They write to cloud stores, so updating and re-running them is a separate decision (`status.md` § Security pass, step 6). Do not read a red result there as a regression until they are.

```bash
# Full suite
docker exec kairos-backend-api python -m pytest tests/ -q --timeout=120

# Single file / single test
docker exec kairos-backend-api python -m pytest tests/test_events.py -v --timeout=120
docker exec kairos-backend-api python -m pytest tests/test_governance.py::test_promote_quarantine_item -v

# DB-write verification tests (slower — wait for Temporal pipeline ~60s)
docker exec kairos-backend-api python -m pytest tests/test_db_writes.py -v --timeout=180
```

Prerequisites: the stack must be up, and seed users must exist — if login fails, run:

```bash
docker exec kairos-backend-api python scripts/seed_users.py
```

> ⚠️ **Run tier 2 against local stores, never cloud.** The suite creates and purges test
> entities and the teardown purge is unreliable against cloud Supabase, so a cloud run
> pollutes the golden dataset. Bring up `docker compose --profile local-stores up` and point
> `.env` at the local containers (see `INFRA.md` §`NEO4J_LOCAL_PASSWORD`). Set
> `KAIROS_SKIP_TEST_CLEANUP=1` to skip the purge entirely.

### CI

`.github/workflows/tests.yml` mirrors the two tiers:

| Job | Needs | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| `unit` | nothing | Runs the 960 service-free tests on every push and fork PR, plus the benchmark grader selftest. Must stay green. |
| `integration` | `--profile local-stores` + a **throwaway** `CI_SUPABASE_*` project | Runs the full suite. **Skips with exit 0** when `CI_SUPABASE_URL` is unset, so a missing optional credential is never a red build. |

Neo4j, Qdrant, Elasticsearch and Redis run as local containers in CI, so Aura and Qdrant Cloud
are never touched.

To enable tier 2, set the secrets yourself — there is deliberately no script that reads them
out of `.env`:

```bash
gh secret set CI_SUPABASE_URL                # from a THROWAWAY Supabase project, not production
gh secret set CI_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
gh secret set CI_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
gh secret set CI_SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET
gh secret set NVIDIA_NIM_API_KEY
gh secret set JINA_API_KEY
gh secret set GROQ_API_KEY
```

> **Recommended: leave the integration job disabled.** Enabling it costs **~20 provider calls
> per push** — every `/search` embeds the query via Jina, `/search/synthesize` walks the
> Token Factory → NIM → OpenRouter → Gemini cascade, and elicitation calls the LLM. Gemini's free tier is a few hundred requests/day and
> is shared with the benchmark harnesses, so a busy day of pushes exhausts it; once it 429s,
> synthesis silently returns no answer and *measured answer quality collapses* (observed:
> 24/25 → 13/25). Tier-1 gives 960 service-free tests with **zero** provider calls, which is the
> signal CI should be providing. Enable tier 2 only for a deliberate pre-release run, against
> a throwaway Supabase project.

**Never point CI at the production Supabase project** — `make init-all` reinitialises schema and
the suite purges entities, so it would corrupt the golden dataset on every push.

```

Suite size: **1,201 tests collected** across 69 files for the full suite at `pytest tests/ --collect-only` on 2026-10-03 (960 are service-free, the rest need the stack). The last full green run was **412 passed · 0 failed** (2026-08-22) and is **superseded**. **There is no current full-suite pass count**: re-run tier 2 against local stores
to get one, and do not quote 412 as a pass figure for the present tree. **1 known transient flake**
(`test_briefs.py::test_attribution_worker_queues_recheck` — a work-order POST occasionally 500s under
concurrent load; passes deterministically in isolation).

**Volume mounts** (in `docker-compose.override.yml` under `kairos-backend-api` — they are dev-only;
the base `docker-compose.yml` bakes code into the image and mounts no source):

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./backend:/app
  - ./tests:/app/tests         # test files
  - ./pytest.ini:/app/pytest.ini
```

**Environment variables** set on the container for tests:

| Variable | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `PYTHONPATH` | `/app` | Ensures `tests/` resolves to `/app/tests/`, not the ML library's `tests` package in site-packages |
| `OT_CONNECTOR_URL` | `http://kairos-backend-go:8090` | Go connector URL (different inside vs. outside Docker) |
| `API_BASE_URL` | *(unset — defaults to `http://localhost:8000`)* | FastAPI base URL; localhost works inside the API container because uvicorn binds there |

---

## Configuration (`pytest.ini`)

```ini
[pytest]
asyncio_mode = auto     # all async tests run automatically without @pytest.mark.asyncio
testpaths = tests
timeout = 90            # per-test timeout in seconds (overridable per-request with timeout= param)
pythonpath = .          # adds rootdir to sys.path (belt-and-suspenders alongside PYTHONPATH env)
```

---

## Fixtures (`tests/conftest.py`)

All fixtures are **session-scoped tokens** (sync) + **function-scoped async clients**.

### Admin auth — INTERNAL_API_KEY (never expires)

`admin_client` does **not** log in via Supabase. It uses the static `INTERNAL_API_KEY` (`kairos-internal-dev-key`) as a Bearer token. FastAPI's `get_current_user` detects this key and returns `role=admin` without calling Supabase. This eliminates JWT expiry failures mid-run.

```python
admin_client     # AsyncClient with Bearer kairos-internal-dev-key (role=admin, never expires)
```

### Tokens — session scope (sync `httpx.post`)

```python
engineer_token   # logs in as engineer@kairos.local — role: engineer
field_token      # logs in as field_worker@kairos.local — role: field_worker
```

Session scope avoids re-authenticating on every test. Sync `httpx.post` avoids event-loop scope conflicts with pytest-asyncio.

### HTTP Clients — function scope (async)

```python
admin_client     # AsyncClient with INTERNAL_API_KEY (role=admin)
engineer_client  # AsyncClient authenticated as engineer
field_client     # AsyncClient authenticated as field_worker
anon_client      # AsyncClient with no auth header
```

Each test gets a fresh client, ensuring no state bleeds between tests.

### Shared asset — session scope

```python
shared_asset_id  # Creates one PUMP asset once; reused by tests that need an existing asset
```

Tests that need deduplication isolation must create their own assets with `uid()`.

### `uid()` utility

```python
from tests.conftest import uid
# returns uuid4().hex[:8].upper() — e.g. "A3F2C1B9"
# used to generate unique IDs per test run to avoid collisions
```

### Data hygiene — automatic teardown

Tests run against the live stack and create ephemeral entities with known id prefixes
(`ASSET-TEST-`, `ASSET-DEDUP-`, `ASSET-EV-`, `ASSET-ACK-`, `WO-*`, `DOC-*`). A session-scoped
autouse fixture in `conftest.py` (`_cleanup_test_data`) purges all of them at the end of the run
via `scripts/purge_test_data.py`, so the suite no longer accumulates junk in Neo4j, Supabase, or
Elasticsearch.

- Skip cleanup for a run: set `KAIROS_SKIP_TEST_CLEANUP=1`.
- Clean up manually at any time: `make purge-test-data`.
- Cleanup never fails the suite — if a store is unreachable it logs and moves on.
- Do **not** rely on UI-side filtering of test prefixes to keep demos clean; keep the *canonical*
  state (the golden dataset, see [`DATASET.md`](./DATASET.md)) free of test data by rebuilding.

## Test files and coverage

### Conformance workstreams — service-free (added 2026-08-16)

These run with **no stack, no secrets, no network** and are part of CI's `unit` job. They were
written service-free deliberately: Supabase has no local counterpart, so a write-heavy test would
have to hit the production project.

| File | Covers | Cases |
|---|---|---|
| `test_briefs_countersign.py` | PTW dual sign-off — two distinct signers required, self-countersign rejected, double-countersign rejected. Includes the regression for scoping the read by recipient, which made every real countersign 404. | 7 |
| `test_topology_verify.py` | P&ID element-by-element gate — partial confirmation does not promote, one disputed element blocks canonical, confirming promotes the existing edge. Includes the `.neq()`-vs-NULL regression that emptied the element map. | 11 |
| `test_ot_coverage.py` | Coverage from **verified** topology only; unverified topology is not coverage; no linked drawing → `none`, never a fabricated tag. | 6 |
| `test_phase_gate.py` | Deployment phases — default is 3 (inert), phase 1 disables synthesis, phase < 3 persists a brief but suppresses the push. | 6 |
| `test_extraction_path.py` | `extraction_path` / `handwriting_suspect` on every OCR envelope; engineering drawings excluded; confidence untouched by the flag. | 8 |
| `test_timestamp_alignment.py` | Cross-**source-system** drift only; same-source events are not drift; unparseable timestamps skipped rather than read as epoch-zero. | 9 |
| `test_model_gate_classes.py` | Per-asset-class gate — a regressed class is blocked, others unaffected, enforcement off by default, lookup failure fails **open**. | 6 |
| `test_superseded_filter.py` | **Superseded documents must not read as current.** ES and Qdrant both exclude them by default; the exclusion is `must_not superseded`, never `must active`, because `kairos_assets` docs and pre-existing Qdrant points carry no `status` at all and would otherwise vanish. Time-travel (`as_of`) re-includes them. Covers the `Filter(must=…) or None` regression that dropped the exclusion when no other condition existed. | 7 |
| `test_brief_signing.py` | **HMAC acknowledgment signatures.** Deterministic, and bound to every fact it claims — brief, signer, action, timestamp, key. A signature captured on one brief cannot be replayed onto another, and ack vs countersign never collide. | 3 |
| `test_ner_parse.py` | **NER truncation recovery.** `max_tokens: 1024` truncates the JSON on entity-dense documents; `json.loads` rejected the whole response and the document fell to the regex path (ASSET_TAG only). Salvage keeps the complete objects and flags `parse_recovered`; unrecoverable garbage still returns `None`. | 8 |

`test_query_category.py` also gained the post-synthesis safety gate cases and the
`parse_synthesis_response` regressions (missing `ANSWER:` marker; RCA citing a document called
`None`).

> **What these cannot catch.** Every bug this project's unit suite has missed was a *query
> semantics* bug — `.neq()` against a NULL JSONB key, `.in_()` against a set the fake ignores. Test
> doubles implement filters as passthroughs, so a filter whose bug *is* its filtering always passes.
> Those need a real database or a real browser; see `implementation/e2e-sweep.md`.

| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `test_health_returns_200` | `GET /health` → 200 |
| `test_health_response_shape` | Response has `status`, `timestamp` fields |
| `test_health_detailed` | `GET /health/detailed` as `admin_client` (the route needs a sign-in) → all 5 service pings succeed |

### `test_auth.py` — Authentication (Layer 0, 8 tests)
| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `test_login_admin` | Admin JWT obtained |

### `test_assets.py` — Asset MDM (Tasks 1-3, Layer 1, 15 tests)
| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|

| `test_field_worker_cannot_create_asset` | Role enforcement: field_worker → 403 on POST |
| `test_field_worker_can_list_assets` | field_worker can GET /assets/ |

### `test_documents.py` — Document Vault + Pipeline (Tasks 4-8, 20, Layers 2-3, 16 tests)
| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `test_ingest_document_accepted` | POST /documents/ingest → 202, SHA-256 in response |
| `test_ingest_duplicate_is_idempotent` | Same bytes → status=duplicate, same document_id |
| `test_ingest_document_linked_to_asset` | `asset_id` param links doc to asset in Supabase |
| `test_pipeline_advances_beyond_queued` | Temporal worker moves stage past "queued" within 60s |
| `test_get_extraction_status` | GET /documents/{id}/status → pipeline_stage field |

| `test_topology_endpoint_exists_for_pid_drawing` | P&ID drawing → topology endpoint responds (200 or 404, never 5xx) |

### `test_db_writes.py` — DB-Level Write Verification (Tasks 4-6, Layers 2-3)
Queries Neo4j, Qdrant, and Elasticsearch directly after the document pipeline completes. These tests are slower (~60-90s) because they wait for the full Temporal pipeline.

| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `test_neo4j_knowledge_edge_written` | All 6 required KNOWLEDGE_EDGE properties present: `valid_from`, `valid_to` (stored as sentinel `9999-12-31 23:59:59 UTC` for open-ended edges — Neo4j drops null properties so a real datetime is used), `authority_level`, `document_id`, `confidence`, `verification_status` |
| `test_neo4j_document_node_written` | Document node is merged into Neo4j with matching `document_id` |
| `test_qdrant_vectors_indexed` | At least one vector chunk in `kairos_documents` collection with `document_id` payload |
| `test_elasticsearch_document_indexed` | Document findable in `kairos_documents` ES index by `document_id` term query |

> **Timeout:** Use `--timeout=180` when running `test_db_writes.py` alone. The shared test suite uses `--timeout=120` which may be tight for pipeline-heavy tests.

> **`_ingest_and_wait()` helper:** Ingests a document then polls the pipeline status until a terminal stage is reached — `_TERMINAL = {"complete", "review_required", "failed"}`. Intermediate stages such as `ner_running` are passed through without aborting; only genuinely stuck or unknown states cause a skip.

### `test_annotations.py` — NER Active Learning (Task 21, Layer 3, 8 tests)
| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `test_annotation_stats_shape` | `/annotations/stats` returns total, corrections_this_week, top types |
| `test_create_annotation_correct` | `is_correct=True` → 201, feeds validation corpus |
| `test_create_annotation_correction` | `is_correct=False` + corrected_type → 201 |
| `test_create_annotation_feeds_corpus` | Correct annotation appears in validation corpus stats |
| `test_list_annotations_returns_created` | Listed annotations match what was submitted |
| `test_list_annotations_requires_document_id` | Missing `document_id` param → 422 |
| `test_list_annotations_empty_for_unknown_doc` | Unknown doc → empty list, not error |
| `test_annotation_missing_required_fields` | Missing entity_text/type/is_correct → 422 |

> **Note:** Annotations require a real `document_id` (FK constraint on `ner_annotations`). Tests ingest a document first.

### `test_events.py` — Event Ingestion (Tasks 13-16, 33, Layer 8)
| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `test_ingest_work_order` | 202, `status=accepted`, `brief_task_id` present |
| `test_work_order_deduplication` | Same payload twice → second is `deduplicated` |
| `test_work_order_recurring_detection` | `recurring_detected` field present on second WO |
| `test_get/ack_event` | Event retrieval and acknowledgement |
| `test_ingest_ptw` | PTW event → `priority=critical`, `brief_id` generated |
| `test_ingest_shift_handover` | Handover event → brief task queued |
| `test_ingest_alarm` | Alarm → 202 accepted |
| `test_ingest_tag_out` / dedup | LOTO tag-out + deduplication |
| `test_ingest_inspection_complete_passed` | High confidence → `quarantine_item_id=null` |
| `test_ingest_inspection_complete_low_confidence_quarantined` | confidence < 0.7 → quarantine |
| `test_deviation_flag_and_resolve` | Flag deviation → resolve with `disputed` resolution |
| `test_deviation_flag_resolve_promoted` | `resolution=promoted` + `moc_warranted=False` → `briefs_unfrozen` in response, `moc_id=null` |
| `test_deviation_flag_resolve_moc_warranted` | `resolution=promoted` + `moc_warranted=True` → `moc_id` starts with `MOC-` |
| `test_ingest_inspection_with_document_id` | Inspection with `document_id` → INSPECTION_RECORD Neo4j edge → `edge_id` non-null |
| `test_set_and_get_plant_state` | Plant state gate: normal/turnaround/shutdown/emergency |

> **Dedup isolation:** Tests that assert deduplication behavior create fresh unique assets with `uid()` to avoid bleeding from `shared_asset_id`.

### `test_briefs.py` — Brief Delivery + EEMUA 191 Governor (Tasks 8, 13, 16, Layer 8)
| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `test_get_my_briefs_shape` | Response includes `briefs`, `total_pending`, `governor_state` |
| `test_governor_ceiling_is_6` | Hard ceiling is exactly 6 pushes/operator/hour |
| `test_governor_state_is_valid_value` | State is one of: normal / suppressed |

| `test_ack_nonexistent_brief_returns_404` | POST `.../ack` for non-existent brief → 404 |
| `test_brief_feedback_requires_rating` | Feedback with valid rating → 200/404/422, never 500 |
| `test_ack_brief_via_ptw` | PTW with `issuing_engineer_id=service-kairos-connector` → `brief_id` returned immediately → ack → 200 with `status` field |
| `test_attribution_worker_queues_recheck` | `rating=incorrect` on a real brief → `confidence_recheck_queued` row in `audit_log` |

> **UUID requirement:** Brief, conflict, and quarantine endpoints use PostgreSQL UUID columns. Tests use `str(uuid4())` for fake IDs — plain strings cause Postgres parse errors → 500.

### `test_search.py` — Hybrid Search + Synthesis (Tasks 9-12, Layer 11, 11 tests)
| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `test_search_returns_response_shape` | `query`, `results`, `total`, `retrieval_methods` present |
| `test_search_empty_query_rejected` | Missing `q` param → 422 |

| `test_synthesize_response_shape` | POST /search/synthesize → `refused`, `safety_critical`, `sources` |
| `test_synthesize_safety_critical_refusal` | `query_category=max_allowable_pressure` → `safety_critical=True` |
| `test_rca_pack_response_shape` | `/rca-pack` → `timeline`, `hypotheses`, `supporting_documents` |
| `test_rca_pack_refused_on_low_confidence_safety` | `refused` field present and boolean |

> **Safety categories:** Must use exact keys from `SAFETY_CRITICAL_CATEGORIES` in `backend/api/services/llm.py`: `max_allowable_pressure`, `isolation_interlock_sequence`, `torque_specification`, `electrical_rating`, `pressure_relief_setting`, `safety_shutdown_setpoint`. Other strings won't trigger the safety gate.

> **LLM timeouts:** Synthesize and RCA pack tests use `timeout=120.0` per-request — LLM calls can be slow.

### `test_governance.py` — Governance Layer (Tasks 21-25, 34, Layer 7, 23 tests)
| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `test_list_conflicts_shape` | Conflicts list → items/total envelope |

| `test_quarantine_filter_by_review_status` | `?review_status=disputed` filter works |
| `test_promote_quarantine_item` | Low-confidence inspection → quarantine → promote → `edge_id` returned |
| `test_dispute_quarantine_item` | Quarantine item → dispute → `status=disputed` |
| `test_double_promote_returns_409` | Promoting already-promoted item → 409 |
| `test_sla_report_shape` | SLA escalation report fields present |
| `test_circuit_breaker_shape` | SPC circuit breaker states per asset class |
| `test_list_moc_shape` | GET /governance/moc → items/total envelope |

| `test_validation_corpus_stats` | Corpus coverage stats by entity type |
| `test_model_gate_history` | GET /governance/model-gate/history → items/total |
| `test_model_gate_run_requires_admin` | field_worker → 403; admin → 200 with `task_id` |

### `test_compliance.py` — Compliance (Task 26, Layer 7, 9 tests)
| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `test_list_frameworks` | GET /compliance/frameworks → list of regulatory frameworks |
| `test_compliance_dashboard_shape` | GET /compliance/dashboard → gap counts by framework |
| `test_list_gaps` | GET /compliance/gaps → items/total envelope |

| `test_audit_pack_shape` | GET /compliance/audit-pack → `status=draft`, `note` contains sign-off warning |
| `test_audit_pack_oisd_117` | OISD_117 audit pack generated without error |
| `test_gaps_reduce_after_document_promotion` | Promoting a procedure clears its compliance gaps |

### `test_elicitation.py` — Elicitation (Tasks 19, 29-31, Layer 9, 12 tests)
| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `test_voice_note_ingest_accepted` | Audio file upload → 202, `task_id` + `sha256` in response |

| `test_get_offboarding_programme` | GET /elicitation/offboarding/{id} → session items with statuses |
| `test_get_offboarding_questions_for_session` | GET questions for specific session item |

> **Voice note MIME type:** Supabase storage bucket does not allow `audio/wav`. Tests use `application/octet-stream` as content type.

> **Voice dedup is async:** The dedup check reads from `quarantine_items` which is populated by the Celery transcription worker. Both uploads correctly return 202 but the second may not yet show `status=duplicate` synchronously.

### `test_audit_log.py` — Audit Trail (Task 25, Layer 7, 9 tests)
| Test | What it verifies |
|---|---|
| `test_audit_log_shape` | GET /audit-log/ → items/total/limit/offset envelope |
| `test_audit_log_filter_entity_type` | `?entity_type=brief` returns only brief entries |
| `test_audit_log_filter_action` | `?action=brief_acknowledged` filters correctly |

| `test_audit_log_has_entries_after_asset_write` | Log is non-empty after test setup actions |
| `test_audit_log_entry_fields` | Each entry has `action`, `entity_type`, `performed_by` |
| `test_audit_log_filter_combined` | Combined `entity_type` + `action` filter works |
| `test_audit_log_filter_entity_id` | `?entity_id=` filter returns only entries for that entity |
| `test_audit_log_pagination` | Page 1 and page 2 entries don't overlap |

### `test_ot_connector.py` — Go OT Connector (Task 17, Layer 5, 8 tests)
Hits the **Go service at port 8090** (`http://kairos-backend-go:8090` inside Docker, `http://localhost:8090` from host).

| `test_ot_query_requires_asset_and_tag` | Missing params → 400 |
| `test_ot_query_returns_timeseries` | `/ot/query?asset_id=&tag=` → `data[]`, `from`, `to` |
| `test_ot_query_mock_flag` | `mock=true` when `PI_WEBAPI_BASE_URL` not set |
| `test_ot_coverage.py` (6 cases, service-free) | `GET /assets/{id}/ot-coverage` — verified loops yield real drawing tags; **unverified topology is not coverage**; no linked drawing → `none`, never a fabricated tag |
| `test_ot_coverage_unknown_asset` | Unknown asset → 200 with mock coverage (not 404) |
| `test_eam_sync_returns_completed` | `/eam/sync` loads fixture → `status=completed`, `synced>=0` |

### `test_pii.py` — PII redaction, DPDP export boundary (5 tests, **no services**)

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `test_redacts_structured_identifiers` | Email, phone, Aadhaar, PAN, employee ID, shift ID all masked — asserts each literal is *absent* from the output |
| `test_person_names_masked_with_stable_pseudonym` | Same name → same `[PERSON_1]` twice, so cross-references survive |
| `test_equipment_tags_and_part_numbers_are_not_pii` | `EQ-101`, `MS-4471-B`, `XV-203`, `OISD-117` pass through untouched — redaction must not damage operational content |
| `test_clean_text_is_returned_unchanged` | No PII → identical text, `pii_found=False` |
| `test_spans_reference_original_offsets` | Span offsets index the original text, not the masked output |

### `test_query_category.py` — Safety-critical classification + refusal gate (32 tests, **no services**)

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `test_safety_critical_queries_are_classified` (×10) | MAWP, PSV set pressure, isolation boundary, torque, insulation class, ESD setpoint each map to the right category |
| `test_non_safety_queries_are_not_classified` (×4) | Alias, personnel, failure-count, OEM queries return `None` |
| `test_relief_setting_wins_over_generic_pressure` | Ordering guard: "relief valve set pressure" → `pressure_relief_setting`, not `max_allowable_pressure` |
| `test_refuses_safety_query_on_unauthoritative_evidence` | Level-5 field observation only → `refused=True`, `answer=None`, sources still returned |
| `test_authoritative_evidence_clears_the_gate` | Level-3 OEM evidence with no `confidence` field → **not** refused (cascade stubbed) |

### `test_search_fusion.py` — RRF retrieval fusion (6 tests, **no services**)

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `test_bm25_scale_does_not_beat_cosine` | A BM25 score of 98.6 does not outrank a cosine 0.91 at equal authority; the doc both sources agree on wins |
| `test_authority_still_outranks_relevance` | Level 1 before level 5 regardless of fused score — the safety property holds |
| `test_merge_keeps_the_longest_snippet` | Duplicate collapse keeps the richer snippet, so synthesis still sees the fact |
| `test_documents_without_ids_are_dropped` | Empty `document_id` never enters the ranking |
| `test_graph_edge_renders_readable_snippet` | A graph hit carries text, not `""` |
| `test_unverified_graph_edge_is_flagged_quarantine` | `verification_status != verified` → `is_quarantine` |

### `test_ingestion_formats.py` — Spreadsheet + email ingestion (4 tests, **no services**)

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `test_spreadsheet_rows_and_sheet_names_extracted` | Both sheets with names; every cell value present; blank rows dropped |
| `test_unreadable_spreadsheet_degrades_without_raising` | Garbage bytes → empty text + `requires_review`, no exception |
| `test_email_headers_body_and_attachment_names` | Headers, body and attachment *filename* extracted; attachment bytes never inlined |

### `test_http_pool.py` — Pooled HTTP client + embedding cache (8 tests, **no services**)

| Test | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `test_same_loop_reuses_one_client` | Second call in one loop returns the same client |
| `test_new_event_loop_gets_a_fresh_client` | Each `asyncio.run()` loop gets its own client — the Celery case a global client would break |
| `test_closed_client_is_replaced` | A closed client is never handed out again |
| `test_close_is_idempotent` | Double close does not raise |
| `test_cache_never_stores_a_failed_embedding` | `[]` is never cached — would poison every later search |
| `test_cache_evicts_least_recently_used` | LRU order respected at `maxsize` |
| `test_task_is_part_of_the_cache_key` | `retrieval.query` vs `retrieval.passage` do not collide |

---

## What the tests prove vs. what they don't

### Proven
- All API routes exist and return correct HTTP status codes
- Request/response contracts (shapes, required fields, error codes) are correct
- Auth and RBAC: roles enforced correctly (admin vs engineer vs field_worker)
- Deduplication logic works for work orders, tag-outs, documents, voice notes
- Quarantine gate: `confidence < 0.7` routes to quarantine; promote/dispute flows work
- Safety-critical refusal: exact SAFETY_CRITICAL_CATEGORIES trigger `safety_critical=True`
- EEMUA 191 governor ceiling is 6; governor state is valid
- Vault immutability: supersede closes edges, double-supersede returns 409
- Pipeline: Temporal worker advances document past "queued" within 60s
- **Conflict resolution:** non-existent UUID → 404; admin-track → resolved; engineering-track → 400
- **Elicitation responses:** novel troubleshooting and offboarding response submission work end-to-end
- **Go connector WO forwarding:** `POST /eam/work-order` proxied from Go to FastAPI
- **Attribution worker:** `rating=incorrect` → `confidence_recheck_queued` row in audit_log
- **Neo4j KNOWLEDGE_EDGE:** all 6 required properties present and correctly typed
- **Qdrant vectors:** document chunks indexed with `document_id` payload in `kairos_documents`
- **Elasticsearch:** document indexed in `kairos_documents` with correct `document_id`

### Not proven (known gaps)
- **Celery worker correctness end-to-end:** tasks are queued and accepted; the Neo4j confidence update after recheck is not verified — only that the task was queued
- **Concurrent correctness:** dedup under concurrent load, governor under burst
- **Attribution Neo4j edge update:** `confidence_recheck_queued` verifies the task was queued, not that Neo4j confidence values were updated afterwards

## Test users

Seeded by `docker exec kairos-backend-api python scripts/seed_users.py`:

| Email | Password (env var in `.env`) | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `admin@kairos.local` | `KAIROS_SEED_PASSWORD_ADMIN` | admin |
| `engineer@kairos.local` | `KAIROS_SEED_PASSWORD_ENGINEER` | engineer |
| `field_worker@kairos.local` | `KAIROS_SEED_PASSWORD_FIELD_WORKER` | field_worker |
| `reliability@kairos.local` | `KAIROS_SEED_PASSWORD_RELIABILITY` | reliability |
| `compliance@kairos.local` | `KAIROS_SEED_PASSWORD_COMPLIANCE` | compliance |
| `demo@kairos.local` | `KAIROS_SEED_PASSWORD_DEMO` | demo |

> **Admin client in tests:** `admin_client` does NOT use Supabase JWT. It uses `INTERNAL_API_KEY` (`kairos-internal-dev-key`) which never expires. This eliminates mid-run JWT expiry failures on long test suite runs.

## Common pitfalls

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `ImportError: cannot import name 'uid' from 'tests.conftest'` | `PYTHONPATH` not set; site-packages `tests` package wins | Ensure `PYTHONPATH=/app` is in container env (set in docker-compose.yml) and `tests/__init__.py` exists |
| Admin login fails (401) | Test users not seeded | `docker exec kairos-backend-api python scripts/seed_users.py` |
| `422 Unprocessable Entity` on asset create | `criticality` value invalid | Use `critical` / `safety_critical` / `non_critical` — not `high`/`medium`/`low` |
| `500` on brief/conflict fake ID | UUID expected by Postgres | Use `str(uuid4())` not plain strings like `"BRIEF-FAKE"` |
| `500` on voice upload | Supabase bucket rejects `audio/wav` MIME | Use `application/octet-stream` in tests |
| Document ingest returns `status=duplicate` | Same bytes → same SHA-256 | Append `uid()` to content bytes to guarantee uniqueness |
| Work order dedup test fails (first call already `deduplicated`) | `shared_asset_id` was used by a prior test within the dedup window | Create a fresh unique asset per dedup test |
| `test_synthesize_safety_critical_refusal` → `safety_critical=False` | Wrong category key | Use exact key: `max_allowable_pressure` (see `backend/api/services/llm.py`) |
| Search result assertion fails on `score` field | Field is `relevance_score`, not `score` | Assert `relevance_score` |
| OT connector tests fail inside Docker | `localhost:8090` not reachable from API container | `OT_CONNECTOR_URL` env var routes to `http://kairos-backend-go:8090` |
| `test_db_writes.py` times out | Temporal pipeline takes >90s | Run with `--timeout=180` or check Temporal UI at `http://localhost:8088` for stuck workflows |
| `test_neo4j_knowledge_edge_written` fails with missing `valid_to` key | Neo4j silently drops null properties, so a null `valid_to` never appears on the edge | Fixed in `GraphService.create_knowledge_edge()`: open-ended edges now store sentinel `datetime(9999, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59, tzinfo=timezone.utc)` — test passes reliably |
| Mid-run admin token expiry (401 in long runs) | Supabase JWT TTL < 9-minute suite runtime | `admin_client` now uses `INTERNAL_API_KEY` — no expiry; engineer/field tokens can still expire on very slow stacks |
