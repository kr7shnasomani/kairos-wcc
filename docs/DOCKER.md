# Kairos — Docker & Deployment Reference

> **Single source of truth for the container build system, local vs production
> run modes, and AWS deployment.** Read alongside [`INFRA.md`](./INFRA.md)
> (ports, Redis/Qdrant/ES layout, observability) and [`BACKEND.md`](./BACKEND.md).

---

## 1. Design in one picture

Kairos runs one container per service (frontend, API, workers, each datastore,
each observability component). Everything is **local containers except the
managed cloud services**:

| Runs as a container (local / on the AWS box) | Managed cloud service (NOT a container) |
|---|---|
| Frontend, API, Celery + Temporal workers, Go connector | **Supabase** — Postgres DB · Storage (vault, bucket `kairos-vault`) · Auth (JWT) · Vault (secrets) |
| Elasticsearch, Redis, Temporal (+ its own Postgres), Temporal UI, OPA | **Neo4j Aura** — knowledge graph |
| — | **Qdrant Cloud** — vector store · **Grafana Cloud** — observability (traces/metrics via OTLP) |

> **Neo4j + Qdrant moved to cloud.** Their local containers (`kairos-neo4j`, `kairos-qdrant`) are
> **profile-gated** — they do not start by default. Credentials live in `.env` only (never in this
> committed file). For offline dev / tests without touching cloud data:
> `docker compose --profile local-stores up` and point `NEO4J_URI` / `QDRANT_URL` at the local containers.
| | NVIDIA NIM · Jina · Groq (inference APIs) |

There is **no HashiCorp Vault container** and **no app Postgres container** —
those roles are cloud Supabase. The only Postgres in the stack is Temporal's
private internal DB.

---

## 2. Two-file Compose model

The stack is defined by **two files** that select the run mode:

| File | Role | Loaded when |
|------|------|-------------|
| `docker-compose.yml` | **Base — production / AWS-safe.** Non-root images, network isolation, resource limits, healthchecks, only ports **3000** and **8000** published (the API on `127.0.0.1` only), code baked into images. | Always |
| `docker-compose.override.yml` | **Dev.** Source bind-mounts + hot-reload (`uvicorn --reload`, `next dev`, `go run`), runs as root, publishes every datastore/UI port for debugging, **bound to `127.0.0.1`** (`127.0.0.1:7474:7474`, and so on, including the Go connector's 8090). | Auto-loaded by plain `docker compose up` |

```bash
# LOCAL DEV  (base + override, auto)          → hot-reload, all debug ports
docker compose up -d --build        #  ==  make dev

# PRODUCTION / AWS SERVER  (base only + `prod` profile, backend services only)
make prod    # == docker compose -f docker-compose.yml --profile prod up -d <services>
```

Passing `-f docker-compose.yml` explicitly disables the automatic override
merge; `--profile prod` adds `kairos-caddy` (HTTPS). Together they are the dev/prod switch.
The deployed setup and its full procedure are in [`DEPLOY.md`](./DEPLOY.md).

---

## 3. Container stack

| Container | Image | Published (dev) | Published (prod) | Network |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|------------------|---------|
| `kairos-frontend` | `kairos-frontend:local` (multi-stage) | 3000 | **3000** | edge |
| `kairos-backend-api` | `kairos-backend:local` (multi-stage) | 8000 | **8000** | edge, internal |
| `kairos-celery-worker` | `kairos-backend:local` (shared) | — | — | internal |
| `kairos-temporal-activity-worker` | `kairos-backend:local` (shared) | — | — | internal |
| `kairos-elicitation-worker` | `kairos-backend:local` (shared) | — | — | internal |
| `kairos-backend-go` | `kairos-connector:local` (multi-stage) | 8090 | — | internal |
| `kairos-neo4j` | `neo4j:5.20-community` | 7474, 7687 | — | internal · **profile `local-stores` only** (cloud by default) |
| `kairos-qdrant` | `qdrant/qdrant:v1.9.4` | 6333, 6334 | — | internal · **profile `local-stores` only** (cloud by default) |
| `kairos-elasticsearch` | `elasticsearch:8.13.4` | 9200, 9300 | — | internal |
| `kairos-redis` | `redis:7.2-alpine` | 6379 | — | internal |
| `kairos-temporal` | `temporalio/auto-setup:1.24.2` | 7233 | — | internal |
| `kairos-temporal_postgres` | `postgres:14-alpine` | — | — | internal |
| `kairos-temporal_ui` | `temporalio/ui:2.26.2` | 8088 | — | internal |
| `kairos-opa` | `openpolicyagent/opa:0.65.0` | 8181 | — | internal |
| `kairos-caddy` | `caddy:2-alpine` | — | **80, 443** | edge · **`--profile prod` only** |

> Observability containers (`kairos-otel-collector`, `kairos-tempo`, `kairos-grafana`) were **removed** —
> the backend exports OTLP directly to **Grafana Cloud** (see INFRA.md §6).

**The four Python services share one image** (`kairos-backend:local`), built
once and reused — they differ only by `command:`. In prod, **only the frontend
and API are reachable from the host**; every datastore stays on the internal
network.

---

## 4. Networks

| Network | Members | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `edge` | frontend, **api** | Public-facing. Frontend (SSR) reaches the API here. |
| `internal` | **api** + everything else | Datastores, workers, observability. Never published in prod. |

The API is the only bridge (on both networks). The frontend cannot reach Neo4j,
Redis, Elasticsearch, etc. directly — defence-in-depth for the AWS deployment.

---

## 5. Persistent volumes

| Volume | Mounted at | Holds |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| `kairos-neo4j_data` | neo4j `/data` | **Knowledge graph** (was an anonymous volume before — now durable) |
| `kairos-neo4j_logs` | neo4j `/logs` | Neo4j logs |
| `kairos-qdrant_data` | qdrant `/qdrant/storage` | Vectors |
| `kairos-elasticsearch_data` | es `/usr/share/elasticsearch/data` | Full-text indices |
| `kairos-redis_data` | redis `/data` | AOF (streams, cache, Celery) |
| `kairos-temporal_postgres_data` | temporal-pg `/var/lib/postgresql/data` | Temporal history |

`make nuke` (`docker compose down -v`) destroys all of these. Config files
(`infra/**`) are mounted read-only from the repo, not volumes.

---

## 6. Dockerfiles

### `backend/Dockerfile` — multi-stage, non-root
`builder` installs all deps into `/opt/venv` (with the build toolchain); the
`runtime` stage copies only the venv + the runtime shared libs and runs as user
`kairos` (uid 1001). No `HEALTHCHECK` in the image (it serves both the HTTP API
and non-HTTP workers) — the API's health probe is defined in Compose. Default
`CMD` is the API; workers override `command:`.

### `frontend/Dockerfile` — 4 stages
`deps → dev → builder → runner`. **`dev`** runs `next dev` (used by the dev
override). **`runner`** serves the Next.js **standalone** build (`node server.js`)
as non-root user `nextjs`. Requires `output: "standalone"` in `next.config.ts`.
`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_STRICT` (default `false`; `true` turns a 401 into a forced
re-login) are build args in the `builder` stage, baked into the bundle, so a change needs a rebuild.
`next.config.ts` also derives the CSP `connect-src` from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (see `FRONTEND.md` §15a).

### `backend/connectors/Dockerfile` — multi-stage, non-root
`builder` (golang:1.25-alpine — bumped from 1.22 for `x/crypto` 0.52) compiles a static binary,
also used for `go run` in dev. `release`
is a tiny Alpine image with just the binary + `fixtures/`, running as non-root
`kairos`.

**`.dockerignore`** trims each build context: `backend/` keeps `tests/` +
`scripts/` (run inside the container), `frontend/` strips `node_modules`,
`.next`, tests. There is no root `Dockerfile`/`.dockerignore` (removed — no
service builds from the repo root).

---

## 7. Health & startup ordering

Every stateful service has a healthcheck, and dependents wait on
`condition: service_healthy`:

- **API** waits for Elasticsearch + Redis + OPA to be *healthy* (fixes the "API boots before ES and
  exits" race). It no longer depends on Neo4j/Qdrant — those are cloud (reached over the network at
  request time, not gated at boot).
- Workers wait for Redis; Temporal workers also wait for Temporal.
- The local Neo4j container (profile `local-stores`) has a `cypher-shell` healthcheck.

---

## 8. Resource limits

Base sets memory ceilings (`deploy.resources.limits.memory`), honored by
`docker compose up`. Approximate ceilings: ES 2g · API/celery/temporal-worker 1.5g each ·
elicitation 1g · Redis 768m · frontend 2g · Temporal/Temporal-PG 512m · OPA/Temporal-UI/Go 256m.

**Neo4j, Qdrant, and observability (Grafana/Tempo/OTEL) are all cloud now** — not in the default
footprint. That removed ~4.5 GB of ceilings and ~2 GB of real idle RAM off the box. **Default ceiling
≈ 12 GB** (limits are ceilings; real idle usage is ~2–3 GB). Adding `--profile local-stores` re-adds
Neo4j 2g + Qdrant 1g. Size the AWS host for the default (see §9).

---

## 9. AWS deployment

The live deployment and its step-by-step procedure are in [`DEPLOY.md`](./DEPLOY.md). Summary:

- **Host:** one EC2 `c7i-flex.large` (2 vCPU, 4 GiB) in `ap-south-1`, Ubuntu 24.04, 30 GB gp3, an
  Elastic IP and a DuckDNS name. Real peak memory used, measured on production under load: about 2.37 GiB
  (resized down from an 8 GiB `m7i-flex.large` after capping the Elasticsearch heap at 512 MB — see
  `DEPLOY.md` §2; a 2 GiB instance was tested and does not fit).
- **What runs there:** the backend only (API, Celery, both Temporal workers, Temporal + Postgres,
  Go connector, Elasticsearch, Redis, OPA) plus `kairos-caddy` for HTTPS. **The frontend is on Vercel.**
- **Start or update** (on the server, after copying the code as in DEPLOY.md §8):

```bash
make prod    # builds the backend images, then starts the backend services + kairos-caddy
```

- **Never** run `make init-all`, `make seed`, `make load-dataset`, `make purge-test-data` or the full
  test suite on the server — they write to the shared cloud stores (the 🛑 rule in `CLAUDE.md`). A fresh
  server restores the local Elasticsearch index from `db/snapshots/` instead (DEPLOY.md §10).

### AWS security checklist
- **Security group:** inbound **22 (your IP), 80, 443** only. The base file publishes the API's 8000 on
  `127.0.0.1` only, so it stays unreachable from outside even if the security group were widened.
  **Never** open 6379/7233/8181/9200.
- **TLS:** `kairos-caddy` gets and renews a Let's Encrypt certificate for `KAIROS_DOMAIN`. Keep
  `infra/caddy/Caddyfile` free of an `encode` block so Copilot's Server-Sent Events stream unbuffered.
- **Secrets:** `.env` lives only on the server (`chmod 600`), never in images or git. With
  `APP_ENV` anything other than `development` (the only value that enables dev bypasses) the API refuses to
  boot on a default `APP_SECRET_KEY` or `INTERNAL_API_KEY`, an empty `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, an unset
  `MOC_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, or `APP_DEBUG=true`, and the Go connector refuses to start without `CONNECTOR_SHARED_SECRET`
  or with its dev default. Set both secrets in the server `.env` (`DEPLOY.md` §9).
- **Proxy limits:** `infra/caddy/Caddyfile` caps request bodies at 30 MB and sets `X-Content-Type-Options`,
  `Referrer-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security` and drops `Server`.
- **ES has `xpack.security.enabled=false`** — safe only because it is unpublished
  and internal-network-only.
- **Persistence:** the named volumes live on the instance's EBS volume and survive a stop/start.

### Rebuild / redeploy
Re-run the rsync from DEPLOY.md §8 on your Mac, then `make prod` on the server.

## 10. Common operations

```bash
make dev            # local dev stack (hot-reload, all debug ports)
make prod           # backend production stack, on the AWS server only (base + prod profile)
make stop           # docker compose down
make nuke           # down -v  ← destroys ALL volumes
make ps / make logs # status / tail logs

# Rebuild one service (new deps)
docker compose up -d --no-deps --build kairos-frontend
docker compose up -d --no-deps --build kairos-backend-api

# Validate compose before running
docker compose config >/dev/null                        # dev merge
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml config >/dev/null  # prod
```

### Image sizes (measured)
| Image | Dev target | Prod target |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `kairos-backend:local` | ~1.0 GB | ~1.0 GB |
| `kairos-frontend:local` | ~1.2 GB (`dev`, full node_modules) | ~250 MB (`runner`, standalone) |
| `kairos-connector:local` | ~878 MB (`builder`, Go toolchain) | ~36 MB (`release`) |

Dev-target sizes re-measured 2026-08-17 (`docker images`); the prod `runner`/`release` figures are
from the last prod build and are not re-measured on every change.

The backend was ~2.88 GB originally; multi-stage stripped the build toolchain,
and choosing **Path B** (cloud vision model) for the Layer 3 P&ID parser let the
local ML stack (`torch`/`torchvision`/`ultralytics`/`layoutparser`/`opencv`/
`scipy`/`scikit-learn`/`pandas`) be removed entirely — down to **~986 MB**.

> **Layer 3 note.** P&ID topology extraction uses a cloud VLM (`api/services/pid.py`,
> NIM `llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct`) — no local model packages, consistent with the cloud-only
> model plane. If **Path A** (custom YOLOv9 + LayoutLMv3) is ever built, it belongs
> in its **own GPU-backed service** with a separate `requirements-cv.txt` — not the
> shared API/worker image.

## 11. What changed from the original single-file setup

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Compose | one dev-shaped file | base (prod/AWS) + dev override |
| Root `Dockerfile` / `.dockerignore` | empty + orphaned | removed |
| HashiCorp Vault container | ran, unused | removed (cloud Supabase Vault) |
| Neo4j data | anonymous volume (loss risk) | named volume `kairos-neo4j_data` |
| Backend image | single-stage, root, build tools in runtime | multi-stage, non-root, slim runtime |
| Frontend image | dev server only | multi-stage; standalone non-root prod |
| Go connector (prod) | 880 MB builder stage | ~36 MB non-root release stage |
| 4 Python services | 4 separate image builds | one shared image, built once |
| Ports | all datastore ports published | only 3000 + 8000 in prod; dev ports on `127.0.0.1` |
| Networks | one flat network | edge / internal split |
| Healthchecks | missing on Neo4j; API boot race | full coverage + `service_healthy` gates |
| Resource limits | none | memory ceilings on every service |
