## The harness

Self-contained evaluation harness + evidence, in `benchmark/` (mounted into the API container at
`/app/benchmark` — the scripts import the running app, so they execute inside it).

| File | What |
|------|------|
| `run_benchmark.py` | Retrieval · answer quality · provenance · per-category · latency percentiles · 95% CIs · KG-linkage (both cuts) |
| `run_kg_completeness.py` | KG linkage completeness, document-centric, with the unlinked remainder classified and dangling provenance reported separately |
| `run_cross_functional.py` | Cross-functional discovery counterfactual: whole-corpus retrieval vs one function's documents alone. Embeddings only, no LLM quota |
| `run_ocr_gate.py` | OCR accuracy against the dataset's declared clean/degraded pairings. Scores recall of operationally salient tokens, not character error rate |
| `verify_layers.py` | Per-layer smoke + latency (PASS/FAIL table) |
| `run_compliance_eval.py` | **Compliance gap-detection precision / recall / F1** vs ground truth derived from the dataset manifest |
| `run_time_to_answer.py` | **Time-to-answer vs BM25-only keyword search** — machine time, documents opened, modelled human time |
| `run_load_test.py` | **Concurrency sweep** — p50/p95/p99, throughput, error rate, first-bottleneck detection |
| `run_soak_test.py` | **Soak** — RSS and connection-count *slope* under sustained low load, latency drift, error rate, and a post-idle Neo4j recovery probe |
| `questions.json` | **37** domain-expert Q&A across 15 categories, grounded in `dataset/00_Reference/00_KAIROS_CANON.md` |
| `scripts/run_model_validation.py` | **Layer-0 entity-extraction F1** vs `validation_corpus`, per entity type, with extraction-path counts and a `VALID`/`SUSPECT` verdict |
| `RESULTS.md` | Raw output of the scripts (results only — this file holds the interpretation) |
| `scripts/seed_validation_corpus.py` | Seeds the Layer-0 NER ground-truth set (`validation_corpus`) that `scripts/run_model_validation.py` scores. **40 labels** (was 13) as of 2026-08-15 — every one verified present in that document's *indexed* text before being added |

> **Sizes, and what limits them.** The question set was widened **25 → 37** on 2026-08-15, then
> **37 → 46** on 2026-09-13 (personnel, dates, aliases, hydrotest ratio, PG-18 and PESO facts from the

`run_compliance_eval.py`, `run_time_to_answer.py` and `run_load_test.py` cover evaluation criteria
that once had **no number attached** — compliance gap accuracy and time-to-answer are named in the
problem statement, and scalability had only single-user sequential figures behind it. All three
have since been run against a loaded stack and their raw output is in `RESULTS.md` §4–§6.

> Two harness defects were found by running them rather than reading them, both fixed 2026-08-17:
> `run_benchmark.py` had no error handling around its retrieval calls, so one slow `/search` raised
> `ReadTimeout` out of `main()` and **discarded 21 of 37 already-graded questions** — ~20 minutes of
> paced synthesis for zero output. It now degrades a single question's context instead, and
> `--checkpoint` records each graded question as it lands so a crash costs the remainder, not the
> run. `run_time_to_answer.py` fired synthesis **back-to-back with no pacing** (the pattern that
> drives NIM into its timeout tail and drains the free Gemini tier) and allowed **180 s** per call —
> twice the browser's budget — so it recorded latencies no user could experience and scored calls
> the product would have aborted as successes. Both now match `run_benchmark.py`: 15 s pacing, 90 s
> cap.

## Methodology (fully deterministic — no LLM-as-judge)

Grading uses **no LLM**, so every number is reproducible. An LLM judge would be non-deterministic
(breaking that claim), circular (an LLM grading an LLM shares blind spots and rewards confident verbosity),
and slower — a poor fit for a platform whose pitch is reproducibility and provenance.

- **Per-question routing** — each question pulls context from the *right* source: hybrid `/search`,
  the asset's graph `/knowledge`, and/or `/aliases`. Not everything is forced through `/search`.
- **Retrieval** — keyword-in-context signal (does the fact actually reach the synthesis context?).

> **Caveat since 2026-10-01: routing no longer feeds synthesis.** `POST /search/synthesize` now retrieves its own evidence (top 6 of the hybrid search, plus verified P&ID topology for isolation questions) and **ignores** the `context` the harness sends (security review H4: the safety gate must not read evidence from the request). The harness still builds the routed context for the retrieval signal above, but the synthesized answer is judged on the server's own retrieval, so a question whose fact lives only in a graph `/knowledge` or `/aliases` item can now score as retrieved yet fail to answer. `run_benchmark.py` has not been changed or re-run for this. **Every answer-quality figure in this file was measured before the change; re-run before quoting one**.
- **Answer quality** — the synthesized answer must **state the required fact(s) without negating them**:
  `must_all` = every token (exact / multi-part facts like part numbers, pressures, valve sets); `answer_any`
  = any correct-answer token (comparative questions whose correct keyword differs from the retrieval keyword);
  else `expect_any`. A required fact wrapped in a negator (*"not 16.2 bar"*) does **not** count. This kills the
  two failure modes of naive keyword scoring — false positives from negation and false negatives from strict
  wording — while staying deterministic.
- **Provenance** — every non-refused answer must cite `sources[]` (Kairos rule: no claim without provenance).
  A refusal is a valid, correct outcome (the safety gate) and carries its own sources.
- **Per-category scoring** — every question carries a `category` (current-fact, temporal-supersession,
  safety-isolation, counterfactual, alias-resolution, regulatory, traceability, …); results break down by
  category so a regression in one capability is visible, not averaged away.
- **95% confidence intervals** — each headline rate reports a Wilson score interval (the correct CI for small-n
  proportions), so `25/25` reads honestly as "100%, 95% CI [87–100%]" rather than implying infinite precision.
- **Latency percentiles** — synthesis latency is reported p50 / p95 / avg, not just a mean a single slow
  question can distort.
- **Entity-extraction F1 (Layer-0 model gate)** — `run_model_validation.py` scores the NER model against a
  human-verified ground-truth set (`validation_corpus`, seeded from canon by `seed_validation_corpus.py`),
  reporting precision / recall / F1 per entity type. Matching is **partial (span-overlap)** — the NER standard —
  so a prediction of "FISCHER PUMPS LTD." correctly credits the entity "Fischer". Ground truth is anchored to
  clean-text documents so the score isolates NER quality from OCR noise.
- **KG linkage / time-to-answer** — deterministic Cypher + per-request latency.

The grader + stats logic has a stack-free self-check: `python benchmark/run_benchmark.py --selftest`.
Only the *answer text* and the *NER output* are non-deterministic (they come from the LLMs under test);
their grading/scoring is exact. Retrieval / provenance / KG / CIs are the fully reproducible headline figures;
answer-quality varies by ±1 question and entity-F1 by a few points run-to-run (both are stochastic-model
snapshots, not fixed constants).

## Results

Measured **2026-08-16** — the first full sweep on the shipping configuration (37 questions, 40 NER
labels, `NVIDIA_NIM_TIMEOUT=60`). Raw output → [`../benchmark/RESULTS.md`](../benchmark/RESULTS.md).

| PS "Evaluation Focus" criterion | Kairos metric | Result |
|---|---|---|
| **Time-to-answer** | Per-layer latency + synthesis percentiles | **13/13 layers PASS**; synthesis **p50 5.5 s · p95 10.5 s** (Nemotron 3 Ultra on NIM at the 60 s cap, 46 questions, 2026-10-03; p50 1.5 s on Nemotron 3 Super, 2026-09-13) |
| **OCR accuracy (Layer 0 extension)** | Recall of salient tokens (asset tags, measurements, references, dates) vs the clean sibling declared in `dataset_manifest.csv`. **The harness makes no model calls** — it reads text already indexed in Elasticsearch, so it is free and safe to run alongside anything | **Unscoreable 4/4, re-confirmed 2026-08-23** — reported as UNSCOREABLE rather than recall 0.0, because nothing was produced and that is an indexing finding, not an accuracy one. **The two OCR defects behind it are now fixed** (a response key the parser never read, and a size ceiling that silently dropped oversized images); all four images transcribe correctly when probed directly. The gate still scores nothing because these documents were ingested *before* the fix and no reprocess endpoint exists, so their text was never indexed. It moves only after a re-extraction — a cloud-store write, out of scope under the no-cloud-writes rule. See `RESULTS.md` §11 |
| **Cross-functional knowledge discovery** | Counterfactual (`run_cross_functional.py`): questions the full corpus reaches that **no single function's documents** reach alone | **0 of 37** required crossing functions (31/37 reached overall; 21 answerable by one function alone, 7 by two, 3 by three). **A null result, reported as such** — at ~4 documents per function a silo search is near-exhaustive, so there is no gap to close on this corpus (2026-08-23) |
| **KG linkage completeness** | **Document-centric** (`run_kg_completeness.py`): active vault documents with ≥1 `KNOWLEDGE_EDGE` carrying their `document_id`, test artifacts excluded from the denominator, remainder classified | **18/21 (85%) linked · 1 quarantined by design (Layer 6) · 2 unexplained · 0 dangling** · 87 test documents excluded (re-run 2026-08-24 after **D2**'s backfill; see `RESULTS.md` §12). Two of the original four handwritten/degraded documents were re-extracted and now have real graph edges. The 2 remaining unexplained are the degraded scans (`scanned_inspection_degraded`, `scanned_oem_bulletin_degraded`) — both correctly triggered the 2026-08-24 span-confidence gate and stopped at `review_required`, an earlier staging state than formal Layer 6 quarantine, which is why they read as "unexplained" rather than "quarantined" here. The 1 quarantined-by-design item is `regulatory_clause_excerpts.pdf`, unrelated to this fix |
| KG linkage — asset cut | Assets linked into the graph + edge verification (Cypher) | **Not currently trustworthy as published** — the underlying query (`MATCH (a:Asset) RETURN count(a)`) has no test-artifact filter, unlike the document cut above. On 2026-08-24 it reads 16/55 (29%), not because linkage regressed but because the graph now holds far more test-sweep assets than it did when 10/10 was last measured. **Quote the document cut above for the PS criterion** until this query is filtered to match |
| **Query answer quality** | Golden Q&A (46): answer states the correct fact, not negated, with sources | **43/46 (93.5%)**, 95% CI [82–98%]; run validity **VALID**, 39/46 answered by the pinned NIM model (Nemotron 3 Ultra), 6 correct refusals, 1 OpenRouter fallback (3 honest misses — Q20, Q31, Q41, all of which retrieved the fact; 2026-10-03). It was 41/46 on Nemotron 3 Super on 2026-09-13: a different model, so not a like-for-like gain |
| **Provenance** | Does every non-refused answer cite `sources[]`? | **46/46 (100%)**, 95% CI [92–100%] |
| **Retrieval quality** | Does the correct source surface for each question? | **46/46 (100%)**, 95% CI [92–100%] |
| **Entity-extraction accuracy** | Layer-0 model gate: precision / recall / F1 per entity type | **F1 0.805** on 40 labels; PERSON 1.0 (n=7), ASSET_TAG 0.889 (n=30), ORGANIZATION 0.8 (n=3). **`VALID`** — 0 of 15 extractions fell back |
| **Compliance gap detection** | Precision / recall / F1 vs an independently-derived truth table | **P 1.000 · R 0.838 · F1 0.912**, zero false positives |
| **Cross-functional discovery** | Cross-site advisories | 🟦 fixture (single-site MVP, by design) |

> **Comparing against the older 23/25 or 24/25 is comparing different tests.** Those were 25
> questions with eight categories at n=1; this is 37 with none below n=2. Read per-category rates

Why a naive latency comparison would be dishonest: BM25 returns a document list in ~50 ms while
Kairos returns a cited answer in ~8 s. On machine time alone, keyword search wins — the real cost
of keyword search is the human reading the list it hands back. So the harness reports three things
separately and never hides the one Kairos loses:

| Measure | What it captures |
|---|---|
| **Machine time** | BM25-only ES latency vs Kairos retrieval + synthesis. Kairos is slower. |
| **Documents opened** | Rank of the first answer-bearing document in a BM25-only ranking — how many documents an engineer opens before finding the fact. Kairos cites the source, so this is 1. |
| **Modelled human time** | `documents_opened × SECONDS_PER_DOCUMENT + machine time` |

`SECONDS_PER_DOCUMENT` (default 120 s, overridable) is an **explicit assumption, not a
measurement** — change it and the conclusion changes. Answer-bearing ground truth reuses the same
`expect_any` keyword sets `run_benchmark.py` already grades retrieval with, so no new labelling
judgement enters.

### Compliance gap-detection accuracy

`run_compliance_eval.py` scores the `gap` classification against ground truth built from the golden
dataset manifest (which document types are linked to which asset) crossed with each clause's
declared `requires_document_type`. That truth table is constructed **independently of the Cypher
under test**, so a disagreement means real breakage in ingestion → asset linking → equipment-class
applicability → the gap query. Verified to derive **52 applicable (clause × asset) pairs: 37
expected gaps, 15 with evidence** — a discriminating target, not an all-gaps one.

Two honest caveats: it scores whether the system finds the evidence it was *told* to look for, not
whether the clause → document-type mapping is the right reading of each regulation (that mapping is
a human judgement in the seed). And **vessel and compressor clauses apply to zero assets** in the
current dataset, so 4 of 12 clauses are never exercised.

### Scalability

`run_load_test.py` sweeps concurrency (default 1→50) over cheap read endpoints and flags the level
at which p95 exceeds 3× the single-user baseline — that number, not the single-user latency, is the
one to quote. Model-backed endpoints are **excluded by default** so a sweep cannot burn NIM/Jina
quota; `--include-models` opts in. It is a load test, not a soak test: a sweep that finishes in
minutes says nothing about memory growth or connection leakage over hours.

`run_soak_test.py` covers that second question, and reuses the same reads-only endpoint list, so it
**cannot spend provider quota however long it runs**. Three things about how it is graded:

- **The slope is the finding, a single reading is not.** It fits a least-squares slope per hour over
  RSS and connection count, and **excludes the warm-up samples** — pools and the `_LRU` filling to
  their initial watermark is a step, not a trend, and including it once turned a 2-minute smoke run
  into a reported "+728 MB/hour". Below `_MIN_TREND_SAMPLES` it reports **NO DATA** rather than
  extrapolating a leak verdict from noise.
- **The thresholds are fixed and low-ceremony:** memory `FLAT` under +10 MB/h, connections `STABLE`
  under +5/h, errors `CLEAN` under 1%. A few MB/hour is normal for a Python process under load
  (allocator arenas, a bounded cache filling); tens of MB/hour is not. **Read a passing slope as "no
  leak signal at this window length", not as "flat"** — a result at 80–90% of the threshold, inside
  an oscillation band of similar size, is not distinguishable from zero over one hour.
- **Phase 3 is the part with teeth.** After the load stops it idles ~10 minutes — long enough for
  Aura to prune idle pooled connections — then probes each Neo4j-backed endpoint, where a
  `SessionExpired` is a real failure. This is why the soak is run against **cloud stores**: local
  containers do not prune idle connections, so the same run against `--profile local-stores` would
  pass without testing anything.

The harness counts errors but does not classify them, so attributing a burst to store-side resets
rather than application degradation is an inference from its shape (bursty, non-accelerating,
followed by quiet) — say so when reporting it.

## What the fixes did

| Fix | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| **Seed canonical aliases** — loader now writes `alias_table.csv` into `asset_alias_map` | Q08 retrieves (P-101 / Feed Pump A / "the old Fischer") |
| **Ingest family maintenance history** — loader ingests `work_orders_eq101_family.csv` (the EQ-102 counterfactual narrative that no event path indexed) | Q10 retrieves + answers |
| **Wider ES highlight** — `number_of_fragments` 3 → 8 so the snippet spans the doc | Q12 surfaces OISD/PESO regardless of query wording (helps real synthesis too) |
| **Stronger deterministic grader** — `must_all` / `answer_any` + negation guard + provenance gate | kills false positives (negated facts) and false negatives (strict wording), no LLM |

## Notes (honest reading of the numbers)

- **The 3 answer misses are honest, not benchmark bugs.** Q09 (`aggregation` — EQ-101 failure count),
  Q29 (`blast-radius`) and Q35 (`traceability`) all *retrieve* correctly and cite sources; the synthesis
  declines to commit. Q09 has missed since the 25-question era — EQ-101's full failure history lives in a
  family CSV scoped to EQ-102 (one `asset_id` per document) — so it is a standing weakness, not a new one.
  Left visible on purpose; gaming them to 37/37 would defeat a reproducible benchmark.
- **All 3 refusals are genuine, and were audited rather than assumed.** The grader counts a refusal as a
  correct outcome, which means a gate that over-refuses would silently *raise* the score. Each refusal
  (Q07, Q19, Q25) was checked against the graph: no asset involved carries an authoritative (≤L3) source
  for the safety-critical parameter asked. Q25 is the instructive case — the bulletin revising the HE-3xx
  limit to 16.2 bar is linked to **HE-301**, while Q25 asks about **HE-302/303**, so answering would mean
  extrapolating a pressure limit onto assets no source covers. Raw and adjusted scores are identical.
- **The `VIA` column records the answering provider per question.** In that run NIM and OpenRouter both
  served `llama-3.1-70b`, so 11 of 34 OpenRouter answers still counted as the same model. NVIDIA retired
  that model on 2026-09-13 and tier 1 was Nemotron 3 Super 120B (since replaced by Nemotron 3 Ultra 550B, 2026-10-03), so from then on **only `nim` counts as
  the pinned model** — an OpenRouter or Gemini answer marks the run `SUSPECT`.
- **Entity-F1 uses partial-match on a canon-grounded set.** `ORGANIZATION` is canon-limited to 3 samples,
  so a single stochastic miss swings its per-type rate — quote it with the n. The benchmark also surfaced a
  real code smell — `NERService` can drop a regex-added `ASSET_TAG` when the model labels the same token
  `MATERIAL` (dedup collision); noted for a follow-up, out of benchmark scope.
- **A `SUSPECT` entity-F1 is a ceiling, not a score.** Any extraction that falls back lands on the regex
  path, which matches `ASSET_TAG` only, so a run with fallbacks reports a floor on the model's real
  accuracy rather than measuring it. **The current run is `VALID`: 15 of 15 extractions ran on the NIM
  model, zero timeouts and zero parse failures**, so 0.805 is the model's score and not a ceiling.
  Both historical causes are closed — the 30 s timeout (`services/ner.py` now reads
  `NVIDIA_NIM_TIMEOUT`) and the response-parsing defect (`max_tokens: 1024` truncated JSON on
  entity-dense documents; `_salvage_objects` now recovers complete objects from a truncated array).
  Keep this caveat: it is how to read a `SUSPECT` verdict if one reappears.
- **Compliance F1 drifts downward as humans promote knowledge, and that is a property of the harness.**
  Its ground truth is derived from the static dataset manifest, so evidence a human promotes into the graph
  afterwards reads as a false negative. Five of the six FNs in the 2026-08-16 run are one such promotion on
  EQ-101. The truth table is **not** amended to match — that would destroy the independence that makes the
  number meaningful. Precision, the safety-relevant direction, stays 1.000.
- **"0% verified" edges is a safety feature, not a gap.** Every edge is `unverified` until a human promotes
  it (quarantine one-way gate); 0% auto-verified proves the governance gate is enforced.
- **10/10 counts the canonical golden assets** (P-101, HE-301…); integration-test rows are excluded from the
  linkage figure.

## Functional validation (correctness, separate from accuracy)
- Backend test suite: **~175 passed · 3 skipped — *stale: not re-measured since 2026-08-16; ~53 tests added, so treat this as a floor*** (1 = transient NIM timeout in-sandbox).
- Contract tests (`test_contract.py`) pin the API response shapes that historically drift.
- Layer 3 P&ID vision extraction: live-validated on `pid_line3_isolation_boundary.png`.
