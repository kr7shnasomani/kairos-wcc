## 1. Container Stack

All services run as Docker containers. Start with `make dev` (or `docker compose up -d`).

| Container | Image | Port(s) | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|---------| 
| `kairos-frontend` | node:20-alpine (local build) | `3000` | Next.js web app (App Router, dev server) |
| `kairos-backend-api` | Python 3.12 (local build) | `8000` | FastAPI REST API |
| `kairos-celery-worker` | Python 3.12 (local build) | — | Celery workers (ingestion, extraction, attribution, elicitation, transcription, validation) |
| `kairos-temporal-activity-worker` | Python 3.12 (local build) | — | Temporal activity worker (document pipeline) |
| `kairos-elicitation-worker` | Python 3.12 (local build) | — | Temporal worker (elicitation workflows) |
| `kairos-backend-go` | Go 1.25 (local build) | `8090` | OT historian + EAM connector. Go was bumped 1.22 → 1.25 because `golang.org/x/crypto` 0.52 (4 CRITICAL advisories) requires it. |
| `kairos-neo4j` | neo4j:5.20-community | `7474`, `7687` | Temporal knowledge graph — **CLOUD (Neo4j Aura) by default**; local container is profile-gated (`--profile local-stores`) |
| `kairos-qdrant` | qdrant:v1.9.4 | `6333`, `6334` | Vector store — **CLOUD (Qdrant Cloud) by default**; local container is profile-gated |
| `kairos-elasticsearch` | elasticsearch:8.13.4 | `9200` | Full-text search (local container) |
| `kairos-redis` | redis:7.2-alpine | `6379` | Cache + event streams + Celery broker |
| `kairos-temporal` | temporalio/auto-setup:1.24.2 | `7233` | Durable workflow engine |
| `kairos-temporal_ui` | temporalio/ui:2.26.2 | `8088` | Temporal dashboard |
| `kairos-temporal_postgres` | postgres:14-alpine | — | Temporal internal DB |
| `kairos-opa` | openpolicyagent/opa:0.65.0 | `8181` | Policy enforcement — writes + sensitive reads. Reach it as `http://kairos-opa:8181`, **never `localhost`** (inside the API container that is the API itself). Policy is loaded at container start, so `docker compose restart kairos-opa` after editing `kairos.rego` |
| `kairos-caddy` | caddy:2-alpine | `80`, `443` | HTTPS for the API on the deployment server (Let's Encrypt) — **`--profile prod` only**, does not start in dev. See [`DEPLOY.md`](./DEPLOY.md) |

> **Observability is CLOUD (Grafana Cloud).** The former local `kairos-otel-collector`, `kairos-tempo`,
> and `kairos-grafana` containers were **removed** — the backend exports traces/metrics directly to the
> Grafana Cloud OTLP gateway (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` + `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` in `.env`).
> Setup lives in `api/middleware/telemetry.py` (HTTP OTLP exporter, URL-decodes the auth header, appends
> `/v1/traces` · `/v1/metrics`). No-op if the endpoint is unset.

> **Cloud stores:** **Neo4j (Aura)**, **Qdrant Cloud**, and **Supabase** (Postgres + Storage + Auth +
> Vault) are cloud services, not containers — credentials live in `.env` only. The `kairos-neo4j` and
> `kairos-qdrant` containers above **do not start by default**; `docker compose --profile local-stores up`
> brings them back for offline dev / running the test suite without touching cloud data. Point
> `NEO4J_URI` / `QDRANT_URL` at them to use them.
>
> **`NEO4J_LOCAL_PASSWORD` — why the local container has its own credential.** Neo4j rejects any
> initial admin username other than literally `neo4j` (`Invalid admin username, it must be neo4j`),
> so compose hardcodes the user and takes only the password from `NEO4J_LOCAL_PASSWORD`
> (default `kairos_dev_password`). It previously interpolated `${NEO4J_USERNAME}`, which meant the
> local container **crash-looped whenever `.env` pointed at Aura** — precisely when you want local
> stores. To point the app at the local container, also set `NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j` and
> `NEO4J_PASSWORD=$NEO4J_LOCAL_PASSWORD` in `.env`.
>
> **Run modes & networks:** the stack is split into a production-safe base
> (`docker-compose.yml`) + an auto-loaded dev override (`docker-compose.override.yml`).
> Full build/run/AWS details: [`DOCKER.md`](./DOCKER.md).

## 2. Service URLs

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Frontend | http://localhost:3000 |
| FastAPI docs | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| FastAPI health | http://localhost:8000/health/ (liveness, open). `/health/detailed` needs a signed-in user's Bearer token |
| Temporal UI | http://localhost:8088 |
| Neo4j Browser | Aura console (cloud) — or http://localhost:7474 with `--profile local-stores` |
| Qdrant Dashboard | Qdrant Cloud console — or http://localhost:6333/dashboard with `--profile local-stores` |
| Grafana / Tempo | Grafana Cloud (hosted — traces + dashboards) |
| OPA | http://localhost:8181/health |
| Go Connector | http://localhost:8090/health (every other route needs `X-Connector-Secret`) |

**Dev ports bind to loopback.** `docker-compose.override.yml` publishes the datastore, Temporal, OPA and Go connector ports as `127.0.0.1:<port>:<port>`, so a dev machine on a shared network does not expose them (the connector forwards to the API as admin). They are still reachable from the host at `localhost`. The base file publishes only 3000 and, on `127.0.0.1`, 8000.

**`CONNECTOR_SHARED_SECRET`** (default `kairos-connector-dev-secret` in `.env.example` and compose) is passed to the API, the Celery worker and the connector. The connector refuses to start without it, and outside `APP_ENV=development` refuses the default.

## 3. Redis DB & Stream Allocation

### DB Allocation

| DB | Use |
|----|-----|
| `0` | Application cache + event streams |
| `1` | Celery broker + result backend |
| `2` | Redis Streams (reserved) |

> **Docker note:** Inside containers, `localhost` is not the Redis host. `docker-compose.yml` explicitly sets `REDIS_URL=redis://kairos-redis:6379/0` and `CELERY_BROKER_URL=redis://kairos-redis:6379/1`.

### Redis Streams

| Stream Key | Content |
|------------|---------|
| `kairos:events:work_orders` | WorkOrderEvent payloads |
| `kairos:events:ptw` | PTWEvent payloads |
| `kairos:events:shift_handover` | ShiftHandoverEvent payloads |
| `kairos:events:alarms` | AlarmEvent + DeviationFlagEvent payloads |
| `kairos:events:tag_out` | TagOutEvent payloads |
| `kairos:events:inspections` | InspectionCompleteEvent payloads (non-failed) |
| `kairos:events:briefs` | Assembled brief delivery messages |

---

## 4. Qdrant Collections

| Collection | Dimensions | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|---------| 
| `kairos_documents` | 1024 | Document chunk embeddings (jina-embeddings-v3) |
| `kairos_knowledge` | 1024 | Knowledge graph concept embeddings |

Created on startup by `VectorStoreService.ensure_collections()`.

---

## 5. Elasticsearch Indices

| Index | Content |
|-------|---------|
| `kairos_assets` | Asset tag numbers, names, equipment class |
| `kairos_documents` | Document content + metadata (full-text) |
| `kairos_events` | Operational event log |

Created on startup by `SearchEngineService.ensure_indices()`.

> **Boot race:** `kairos-backend-api` calls `ensure_indices()` on startup and **exits** if Elasticsearch isn't ready yet. After `make dev`, if the API is down, `docker restart kairos-backend-api` once ES is healthy.

---

## 6. Observability Pipeline

```
FastAPI API
  → OTLP/HTTP (api/middleware/telemetry.py)
  → Grafana Cloud OTLP gateway  (OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT + Authorization header, both in .env)
    → traces + metrics, viewed in the hosted Grafana Cloud UI
```

Endpoints are derived as `<endpoint>/v1/traces` and `<endpoint>/v1/metrics`; the auth header is
URL-decoded (`%20` → space) before use. The whole block no-ops if `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is unset.

**FastAPI auto-instrumentation:** `FastAPIInstrumentor`, `RedisInstrumentor`, `HTTPXClientInstrumentor`.

### Custom Metrics

Defined in `api/services/metrics.py` and exported over OTLP to Grafana Cloud — **there is no local
scrape endpoint**. The `:8889/metrics` address documented here previously belonged to the
`kairos-otel-collector` container, which was removed when observability moved to Cloud.

| OTEL instrument | Prometheus name | Instrument type | Labels |
|---|---|---|---|
| `kairos.briefs.delivered` | `kairos_briefs_delivered_total` | Counter | `priority`, `trigger_event_type` |
| `kairos.governor.suppressed` | `kairos_governor_suppressed_total` | Counter | `user_id` |
| `kairos.ingestion.duration` | `kairos_ingestion_duration_seconds` | Histogram | `document_type` |
| `kairos.conflicts.open` | `kairos_conflicts_open` | UpDownCounter (renders as a Prometheus gauge) | `track` |

---

## 7. Grafana Dashboards

**Hosted on Grafana Cloud.** Traces + metrics are exported via OTLP (see §6); view them in your
Grafana Cloud instance. (Pre-cloud, dashboards ran in a local `kairos-grafana` container at `:3001`.)

| Dashboard | UID | Panels |
|-----------|-----|--------|
| Kairos — Ingestion Pipeline | `kairos-ingestion` | 6 panels: docs/hr, p50/p95 duration, ingest rate, type breakdown, request rate, error rate |
| Kairos — Operational Intelligence | `kairos-operational` | 9 panels: briefs/hr, governor suppression, open conflicts, suppression rate, briefs over time, briefs by priority, conflicts by track, governor per-user, traces explorer |

**Both dashboards are imported and live** (2026-08-15) at `/d/kairos-ingestion` and
`/d/kairos-operational`, wired to `grafanacloud-prom` and `grafanacloud-traces`.

Import from **`infra/grafana/dashboards-import/`**. Those JSONs use `__inputs` placeholders for the
datasources, which is what makes Grafana show a datasource picker on the import screen. (The old
`provisioning/` copies hardcoded datasource uids that do not exist in a Cloud stack, and were deleted.)

> **Custom metrics require telemetry in *every* process that records them.** `services/metrics.py`
> instruments are no-ops without a MeterProvider, and the Celery worker never called
> `setup_telemetry()` — so `kairos_briefs_delivered_total` and `kairos_governor_suppressed_total`,
> which are recorded inside Celery tasks (`brief_engine`, `event_bus`), could never reach Grafana
> no matter how much real traffic ran. Fixed 2026-08-15: `celery_app.py` calls `setup_telemetry()`
> on `worker_process_init` (per forked child — an exporter thread does not survive a fork), and
> `setup_telemetry(app=None)` skips the FastAPI-only instrumentation. Verified by delivering a real
> brief and watching `kairos_briefs_delivered_total` appear in Grafana Cloud.

# Deletes ONLY the prefixes/ids named in purge_test_data.py — NOT `WO-*` or `DOC-*`.
# Those wildcards are the mental model that once DETACH DELETEd four real documents:
# real ids are `DOC-` + 12 random chars, so a bare `DOC-X` prefix matched ~1 in 36.
# Whole ids live in the _EXACT lists and are matched by equality.

### After `make nuke`

```bash
make dev → make init-all → make seed → make load-dataset
```

### Before a demo: warm the stack

The first minutes after `make dev` are CPU-bound (Turbopack compiling each route on first visit,
Elasticsearch booting, cold Aura connections). OPA decisions then take >2 s, `_ask_opa` times out, and a page
that fires several reads at once trips the frontend's 4 s budget ("signal timed out"). Wait for
`/health/detailed` (needs a Bearer token now; the Go connector's and the API's own `/health/` need none) to report `"status":"ready"`, then open `/overview` once before
demoing. Nothing is broken; a retry succeeds once warm.
